Are PhDs really required to work in an AI lab?
I have a French engineering degree (equivalent to an MSc), majored in datascience and robotics, and
an other masters in applied math on top of it and I am really struggling to find work in an AI lab. I've
been working as a datascience consultant for a year now in one of the biggest/best datascience
consulting outfits in Paris, thinking wrongly that the technical/theoretical level would be higher than it
is. I am doing really basic regressions in R and pumping out powerpoint presentations.
I've been trying for the last 3 months to find positions in any company that claims to have an AI
research division. The problem is for smaller companies, I found that most offers with AI in the title are
basically doing what my consulting firm does, use AI and datascience as buzzwords to upsell
themselves. I really do not want to change jobs only to do basic stuff and powerpoint presentations.
And for the big ones, the few positions I come across for which I know the company really does
research (Google, FB and co) I haven't been able to go past the HR phone interview (I have applied
worldwide). Seeing as these positions ask for PhDs or MScs, my questions would be:
1. Considering my background and experience, am I deluded in thinking I have a shot at the big
ones ?
2. If I don't have a shot, why? Is it because of a lack of education ? the perceived quality of my
education (not stanford or MIT) ? Is it because I pigeonholed myself in a consulting job ?
3. What should I do to maximize my chances, should I go back to academia and get a PhD ? Should
I work in an AI startup to wash away the consultant stigma/ build my public github (can't really
share what I'm doing as a consultant) ?

The real question you need to answer (and be really honest about) is the question of what do
you REALLY want to do?
When you say "research", do you mean fundamental research (e.g. "what does th error
surface of a neural network look like?"), applied research ("can I use deep learning to solve
problem $X?"), product development ("how exactly do I implement a semantic segmentation
CNN to recognize pedestrians in my car") or do you just want to get into this area because it's
hip/well payed and don't really care about the contents?
I've asked these questions in decreasing likelihood of needing a PhD. Let's go through them
step by step:
In my experience, industry AI research labs that do fundamental research (especially the ones
you apparently want to get into, like Deepmind, Google Brain or Facebook AI Research) hire
scientists. Having a Master's degree or two (or consulting experience) doesn't make you into a
scientist. Because that's what a PhD is for: to teach you how to be a scientist. Your
consultancy will not mean much, because when you're consulting, you don't need science
skills. Sure, you need analytical skills and you need to know how to apply existing methods,
but that is not what DOING SCIENCE means. You have to learn to ask the right questions
(Step 1), know how to approach that question scientifically (Step 2) and then, work hard until
you have your solution (step 3) and then analyze that solution (step 4) and maybe
communicate those results (step 5). More than likely, right now you only know how to do step
3 (and 5), because up to Master's level, that's what university education mainly focuses on, in
my experience (YMMV, I haven't met many French ppl). So it's no wonder the big labs aren't
interested in hiring you as a scientist, because from your CV, it's apparent that you are not a
scientist.
Go and look at the papers of the top conferences, where the labs you want to get into actually
publish. Are you, right now, consistently capable of producing research like that? I don't mean
just understanding those papers and being able to re-implement them. You hopefully are
able to do that. But would you be able to come up with solutions like that? Would you even
think of trying to solve problems like this one? Would you be able to come up with the
math/proofs required to show the theoretical background, would you know how the stuff is
connected to all the other stuff currently being researched (so you know what else to cite)?
Because those are the skills that scientists have.
And if you really do already know how to do all of that stuff, then your CV should clearly
reflect that: Where are the papers at top conferences that you authored yourself? Everything
else barely matters for true research positions.

Now, the thing is that there are still fewer scientists than there are open positions for ML
scientists. And even among people with PhD, there's a wide range of quality differences. So
research labs DO actually hire some scientists-to-be, as long as they're very promising. Some
even collaborate with some universities so they can snag promising talents from there, or
have programs to produce their own new scientists (e.g. in residency programs). But you'll
still need to show that you are able to do science (or will potentially be in the future) . I don't
think having a Master's and some Consultancy job are enough to show that you have
promise as a scientist. Having a paper at a good conference does that. If you're just an MSc,
even a mediocre conference or a workshop is a good indicator. At the very least, find an
reputable reseracher who can vouch for you. But IMO, doing a PhD is your very best option if
you want to do fundamental research.
If instead of fundamental research you want to do applied research, the game gets a little
easier, because it's easier to get your foot in the door in an applied field (I think). The bar of
entry is a bit lower, I think, because simply knowing the applied field will get you far. It's also
easier to move laterally (e.g. from the software developer that writes the front end to ML
engineer that implements the algorithms in the backend to the applied researcher who
actually develops the algorithms).
For both kinds of research, the PhD is not the only way to entry, albeit the most common. Of
course you can write blogs, re-implement stuff and have side projects on github for that kind
of stuff (since a lot of it is applying existing science to new problems), and that's a good way
to show people you're a motivated, interested and capable person. Especially for people with
good analytical skills. But still, if research is your end goal (no matter if applied or not), a PhD
is the usual career path choice. And with how the field is growing, it's likely to only get harder
to get into the field without the proper education ( = without doing a PhD).
Lastly, if you want to do development, I think you should have no problem getting a job with
your current skill set.
However, the main question that puzzles me: if you really want to do RESEARCH, why aren't
you doing a PhD already? Because that's pretty much exactly what a PhD does day-in, day-
out. You don't need to work at Google to do cool AI stuff. Most of the very cool research in
the field is done in academia by PhD students! (after you finish your PhD, it should be no
problem to move into an industry research position for more money)
Disclaimer: this is just my personal opinion & experience. YMMV.
TL;DR: if you want to do research, start by doing a PhD
EDIT: a lot of people have contacted me and are worried because they might not be "good
enough at math/proofs" to do a PhD. Don't sweat it! You're supposed to learn on the job, and
a solid grasp of undergrad math will get you a long way. No-one expects you to be a math
whiz. It's true, ML is an analytical field were we're trying to find well-founded answers using
math, but enthusiasm and curiosity about the field is all you need. The rest will come with
time. What I talked about in this post is what I personally expect an ML research scientist to
be able to do AFTER having completed a PhD, not before (and of course, not everyone has to

The reasons for me getting into consulting instead of a PhD are the following:
I was a little lied to by the consulting firm in which I am on their level. We have an "AI
lab", we have PhDs working here, partners teach classes at other engineering schools,
etc. I thought going in that I had found the golden ticket, I would get to do advanced
stuff, develop and apply new solutions all the while being well payed etc. This clearly
isn't the case and is my fault.
I thought that the data, problems and solutions consulting firms have access to would
be the most interesting. In a caricatured way, public datasets have been studied to
death, the only place to find cool unexplored datasets and problems is deep inside
companies' datalakes.

Although not relevant to my ML background (hence why I didn't mention it), I did 2 six
months internships before finishing my degrees (gap year) one in M&A and one in
business intelligence. So I had already gotten a taste of a work environment and liked
it.
To answer the first question, I guess I want to do applied research. I really enjoyed writing
my master thesis on WGANs for my "master recherche" in applied math. So I guess that's
what I want to do. It's just that both degrees + gap year of internships + my year of
experience make 7 years already, I really hoped it would be enough, I am not asking to
become the head honcho at google brain overnight, I want to work on cool stuff with cool
people.

For applied research, I think it might be easier to move into the area. But especially for
the big labs, you are competing with PhDs that have an education as scientists. If you
neither have large experience with the applied field, nor research experience with ML,
this will be hard (And a "master recherche" isn't 'research experience'). You can improve
your hireability by showing that you have relevant experience in the field: writing papers
is likely too hard, but you can still write blogs about ML side projects or contribute to
relevant open source packages. Still, since you said:
I want to work on cool stuff with cool people
Doing a PhD offers you exactly that. The paycheck sucks compared to industry, but all
the other things are exactly what a PhD does. And you get access to enough unexplored
datasets and problems if your lab has interesting research collaborations.

being already submitted to such a fate.

In the genuine companies are you applying directly to the AI or research roles? It can be
easier to move laterally within a company rather than go straight into a role from the outside.
I'm in a similar predicament to you, and am taking some advice given by Peter Norvig in an
AMA he and some researchers did recently
(https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7yegux/aaas_ama_hi_were_researchers_from_
google/):
"...I can see that it is tough to get a job in AI Research coming straight out of an undergrad
program at a small school. But, you are in a position to get a software engineer position at a
big company, and once you are there, express your interest in AI, learn on the job, keep an
eye out for AI-related projects you can work on, and chances are that in less time than it
would take to do a PhD, you'll be an established AI expert within your company."
This might apply differently to you given your background, ie it might not be a software
engineering role you take at a big company, but the theory remains the same. I don't think
having a PhD is vital, it just alters your route to the end goal. Get your foot in the door based
on what your most qualified in, then use lateral moves to get closer to what you want to do.

Well I didnt see that coming when finding out a chief data scientist has a background

Congratulations on the promotions. However, if you are aware that chief data scientist is
management position and are willing to learn plus aware of what you dont know.
However, every single time I have interacted with an executive level data person who is
out there doing bad data practices like decisioning on absurdly small data samples it has
been someone without a rigorous data background who managed to move up the
corporate ladder without filling in very basic knowledge gaps.
There is nothing sadder than seeing a subordinate who knows his superior is wrong

My personal background leans more on experience, but multiple PhDs work for me

Federal is generally years behind commercial on widescale adoption of ML, but there
are pockets of advanced research such as DARPA, IARPA, and NSA.

Why do folks with bachelors think everything comes down to whether you have a
bachelors or not.
My comment is more about having a strong foundation before being promoted
or being the type of person who is aware of his weaknesses and works to fill them
in as well as knowing limitations.
The reason I emphasize before being promoted is that in a corporate environment
you get promoted by how well you do your current job , how well you are
perceived based on the ability of the promoter to do your promoted job, how
good your personal relationship with those above you are. Many times this will
have little to do with your technical ability and as you move up where you do more
with management skills. Technical ability factors in less.
There are companies whose DNA is built in with technical ability and engineering
who expect and can evaluate technical ability but these companies are few and
far between. I just saw a thread on a related subreddit where an at minimum
Senior Data Scientist will be hired based on a intern as the technical domain
expert.
In most companies at the executive and management level you will be evaluated
by business stakeholders on how well you can manage to contribute to their
bottom line. This creates blind spots in technical ability and for many folks
promotions will create confidence to ignore these blind spots and organizationally
due to your promoted position you will be insulated as well.

Compared to the PhDs I work with, my academic background is limited, yet I've
been very successful. I'm not patting myself on the back, it was intended to
provide encouragement for the exact sort of question this thread was created
to ask.
Having a strong technical foundation to do the job you are being hired to do is
important. I've been doing big data analysis on petabyte+ data sets for years,
and I'm not in this position because nobody vetted my capabilities or I'm
friends with senior executives.
Clearly this is something you feel very passionately about, but I'm not sure
exactly what point you are trying to make. If you are disagreeing that you can
land a data science position from merit by learning the skills outside of a PhD
program and working up through a software company... we are going to have
to agree to disagree.
That being said, I'm happy to discuss more if you like, feel free to PM me. I'll
also be attending Tensorflow Dev Summit in CA this month, so if you happen to
be there I'd love to talk in person.

Simply put into 3 points
A) I agree there are paths to chief data scientist which even involve just a
bachelors and even just a HS degree. However, all the paths which leadup
to chief data scientist without having a superior with strong technical ability
to teach and assess you are a subset of these exact paths.
B) Those paths can lead to very foundational technical blind spots. So if you
are going to go down those paths make sure that in a few instances on the
way up it is under folks with very strong technical backgrounds.
C) The higher up you get promoted if you dont take care of those blind
spots they will become harder to both see and address as management
duties take more of your day to day and the folks you report are more likely
to be less technical

I agree with all 3 points.
I think it's worth mentioning that whatever path you take you are going
to develop blind spots unless you take special care to resolve them. One
of the advantages of my background for example is a strong
understanding of production code. In my experience most data
scientists who have spent more time in academia struggle severely with
documented, reproducible, and tested code when it comes time to
productize experiments. It's not an indictment of the value of academia,
just a blind spot that I often see.
Ideally regardless of the path someone follows, strong technical
fundamentals, a willingness to learn, and self reflection on areas to
improve are all valuable.

There is nobody in a management position who can also be the best engineer or best
scientist for a team, our time is too divided. I try and listen to people smarter than
me, and apply the knowledge I have to make our pipeline work. In our case the
pipeline consists of ML research (mostly focused on human cultural and social
behaviors) which create generalized tools that eventually get productized for end
customers.
I'm fortunate that I get to contribute to the actual ML research and co-write papers,
but I also am stuck at the BD side of things trying to find applications for our
customer base for these technologies. I love the work, and I try very hard to improve,

I think the problem has multiple dimensions happening
A) Data science is slowly becoming more professional which means more and
more doors that used to be open are closing. This is similar to what happened in
CS with programmers where there was a time you could join without even
completing high school but now that door is all but closed as software
development became more professional
B) The outlook for academic science is bleak . Academic science is very
codependent with government and the current climate for science ranges from
lukewarm to downright adversarial. These unemployed or discouraged scientists
still have to work so they move over to data science and ML positions. This floods
the market with adaptable talent for the positions opening up
I am not sure what the best path for a bachelors is outside of networking hard or
developing a very strong expertise in a subject ( the type of kids whose experience
started with building neural nets for fun in high school). The latter I assume isnt
asking the type of question OP is asking because at that age you would gain
mentors to get that strong expertise so they probably fit into the well connected

I work as a Machine Learning Scientist for a start-up, which in theory means I get to do
research in ML. Well, it turns out that in practice, as a small company, you have to spend most
of your time doing engineering stuff, and you only get 5-10% of your time to do "real
research".
Most small companies don't do research. Real research in the industry it's mostly done by the
big fish as they can afford to have a dedicated workforce to do so.
At best, you'll get a position like I have at the moment, but you can not expect too much from
it in terms of research.
Because of this, I'm about to change companies to a Machine Learning Engineer position in a
AI consultancy company. This way, at least I get to work with the state of the art in ML and
apply it to different problems, which for me is a lot more fun, since I'm not doing actual
research most of the time.
I hope my insight helps somehow.
PS: Regarding a PhD, I also applied to one. My perspective is that you need one in order to
climb the ranks in seniority in the industry if you desire a hands on position, as opposed to a
managing one.

I haven't been able to go past the HR phone interview (I have applied worldwide). Seeing
as these positions ask for PhDs or MScs, my questions would be:
Considering my background and experience, am I deluded in thinking I have a shot at the
big ones ?
If I don't have a shot, why? Is it because of a lack of education ? the perceived quality of
my education (not stanford or MIT) ? Is it because I pigeonholed myself in a consulting job
?
I don't think it depends on the degree and the reputation of the school necessarily (although
it might help). I think it depends more on a) your project portfolio (showing what you can
do/already did) and b) how you present yourself (knowledge + personality) during the
interviews.
Just having a Bachelor's degree while being in a grad program at a mid-tier US college at that
time, I did the phone tech interview with Google, which I passed. So it wouldn't say that
either a Ph.D. or being at a prestigious school are necessary to be considered.
I eventually decided not to pursue this further though, (I didn't go to the campus interview)
because during the interview, I realized that this company wouldn't be for me: I would want
to know what I will be working on before I join the company, not afterwards -- or in other
words, how can I be passionate about my job if I don't know what it is, yet.

There are many available PhDs that have defended recently and have already a good
research experience as attested by their publications, why would a company hire you and not
them? You have no experience in AI research, and probably no experience in research
whatever the domain since the typical French engineering degree has very limited options in
that regard.
The only place that is going to accept you to do research without any prior experience is the
academia if you start a PhD, because it's basically its job.
Now, that being said, don't start a PhD if you only want the diploma and not to enjoy the
journey. People that do that generally do not finish their PhD. You have to believe that
working like crazy for 3 years on an insignificant subject with a crappy salary is all what you
ever dreamed of.

If you want to do applied research, this is almost always coupled with a field
anyway (as it is applying ML to something like NLP or vision or something).
Besides, lots of labs aren't "pure" AI and still publish at NIPS.
As far as "random PhD" goes: doing a PhD for the sake of it in a mediocre
department is likely a waste of time. But you don't need to be in a "top 10"
university. You do need to do deliver solid, relevant and novel work, however (and
have an advisor that can help you do that). I can only share my own experience:
My university is far from "top 10", but our lab does have a good track record at the
important conferences (NIPS, ICML, ICLR, ...), and we do what I'd consider
consistently good research. During my PhD, as my research started getting some
attention, I got more and more unsolicited offers from start-ups, collaborators
and the big industry AI labs. So obviously the choice of institution doesn't count as
much; a PhD study is what you make of it.
(If you do decide to go down this route: the one crucial aspect that you cannot
under any circumstances ignore is the choice of advisor, which IMO is much more
crucial than the choice of university. Make sure you pick someone that can show
you not just how to murk along in the scientific world, but one that forces you to
excel in your field and can open doors for you, and the world will be your oister.
As a rule of thumb, I'd recommend to pick someone who is capable of publishing
at ICML/NIPS and isn't overrun with students already)
EDIT: so I guess you could say your university doesn't matter much, but your
advisor/lab should indeed be in the top 100 or so.

Larochelle was at Sherbrooke... both universities that I personally wouldn't
know if it wasn't for those people). There are tons of other examples. On
the flip side, I wouldn't place MIT among the "top 10 universities for
machine learning", despite what you might think. Yes, there are people
there who do very good research, but there are other universities who are
just stronger in this area right now.       . But of course,
top-tier universities tend to attract very good talent, both with regards to
professors and sutdents. And they usually have good programs in place
that will definitely help you do better research. Simply because they have
good teachers and force you to learn a lot of stuff, and because the
university name opens a lot of doors for you anyways. They push you more
towards doing good research, regardless of advisor. But there are certainly
lot of very good ML labs outside of the big universities.

In general, people who manage to consistently publish at top tier
conferences/journal are the people to look out for. In fundamental ML
research, those are NIPS and ICML (there's other decent ones like ICLR,
COLT, AISTATS, UAI, ... , but those two are the most general) . So if you see
someone who got a track record of publishing there, that's a very good
indication that they are doing a very good job. Other very obviously stellar
people are the organizers/committee people at such conferences. Likewise,
if someone mainly publishes at lower-tier conferences (and for someone
who is not in the field, this is unfortunately hard to judge), that's a bad sign.
So if you want to judge someone's research capabilities, look at where they
publish. (note: of course, this says nothing about their true ML skills, just
about how well they do research).

It's not so much the university you get your PhD from than your scientific
production during the PhD. If you do your PhD at MIT but do not have any major
conference or journal paper at the end, people will think you are a joke (both in
academia and in the industry). Conversely, if you do your PhD in some random
university but you manage to finish with 2 NIPS, 1 ICML and a TPAMI, you will
have no problem to find a good position.

This is especially relevant here, because the French education system branches into (i) the
universities and (ii) the engineering schools. The latter ones are considered as elite schools
for historical reasons and are therefore attracting most of the best students.
The point is that because of this, graduating from such a school has been considered more
"prestigious" than doing a PhD; and in fact your chances of getting a job afterwards, even in
R&D, were higher. As a result, students did not feel the need to do a PhD after their
engineering schools (like OP). This is however changing a bit now.

French engineering degree and PhD here, Basically do a PhD if you want to have 3 years to
explore a subject (you don’t get this kind of freedom elsewhere), but it does not help you
much to get a job in AI in France. It does not hinder you either - you are considered as a +3
years of experiences.
In france you have CIFRE PhD, they are not easy to get but you are almost guaranteed to be
hired by a company after.
If you can move in France, you usually can find a company hiring in data science somewhere -
for instance at the time there is lot of things happening in cars related company e.g
continental, ... most company tend though to offer jobs with a mix of big
data/devops/datascience, so you may be disappointed if you are looking for 100% data
science... however, in my experience algorithmes are often the easy part in an industry
pipeline, the hard part being the managment of data.

Disclaimer: I'm doing a PhD in ML after a engineering degree (French engineering school as
well), but I haven't been in contact with companies so far. My last year of engineering school
was a specialization in ML and an internship in an academic lab. I then continued with a PhD
in the same lab. I'd say that my training was insufficient at the start of the PhD and I regret
not spending a year or two with an actual ML master in university (maybe the M2 would be
sufficient if the basics are already known).
basically (and this is only my opinion):
you can make a good master degree like the one at Orsay University, probably the one
at UPMC is good also.
make an intership or work as a research engineer in an academic lab, it will give you
more time to learn than if you work in a startup. If you have done some master courses
before, you will have contacts to find a position and you will be more confident of
finding a good team (FYI: position offers are a legal obligations but are often written
once a candidate is already selected, so you need contacts).
not all start-ups open-source the code, authorship will not necessarily point to you
a friend of mine started looking for a job and was asked if he scored on Kaggle, so you
may want to have a look at that.
I have been told that only the PhD is valued outside of France, in France the Master level
+ experience should suffice.
don't start with the PhD right away, be sure to know the team, the subject etc...

I technically only have a Masters and I work with the title of research scientist at a big
company's R&D lab. Though, I previously worked at a startup that got bought by Microsoft as
a data scientist, and in practice this current lab is more focused on applied than basic
research.
Due to my boss being awesome and giving me free rein on a lot of things, I actually pursue a
fair number of research experiments that range from the highly practical (i.e. can we solve
company problem x with model y), to the highly theoretical (i.e. let's explore what happens if
we modify this deep learning algorithm in this manner that no one seems to have tried or at
least published anywhere, based on some ideas inspired by neuroscience).
That being said, I still have to do a fair bit of engineering to prove to HQ that our research is
worth continuing, and prototype demos every few months are a thing.
Personally I think a PhD is only worth it if you plan to go to a particularly reputable academic
lab like MILA and study with someone like Bengio. Otherwise, you're probably better off
proving your worth by making some spectacular research project and showing it off
somewhere online. Admittedly not everyone has the resources to pull this off, but it seems
like the field is already kind of swapped with folks who are either wannabe ML engineers who
took Andrew Ng's course and now consider themselves experts, or actual PhDs who jumped
on the bandwagon and know a bunch of the theory, but have little actual experience doing
meaningful stuff.
I'd rather take the latter than the former, but honestly, someone who can show both
theoretical knowledge and practical experience is best.
Also, I didn't get into Google back when I first applied fresh out of my masters. They are
notoriously tough with interviews and prefer false negatives to false positives significantly.
Remember that they and Facebook and to a lesser extent places like Amazon and Microsoft
can get the real cream of the crop. My understanding is that you need more than any old
PhD, you need one from MILA or another top lab in the field, and have published in places
like ICML or NIPS.
In a sense I got lucky because I got into industry right before the market got flooded with
people claiming to understand AI and ML who really don't, and so companies have taken a
very skeptical stance on hiring to filter out the wannabes.
When in doubt, don't close any doors. Continue to apply to places in industry and also apply
to universities with reputable PhD programs and see what sticks. Don't be afraid to consider
companies that aren't super famous either. A lot of lesser known labs are actually working
very hard to catch up and attempt to beat the giants at their own game, and in some cases
their relative agility gives them a potential advantage over the more established
organizations that are set in their ways, beholden to certain egos, etc.
The most important tidbit of advice though would be to prove your ability with data. Evidence
of actual research projects of some kind is good. AI and ML are perhaps one of the only fields

where you can literally set up an amateur lab in your basement by acquiring some GPUs and
contribute to science and the actual state-of-the-art if you really work at it. Admittedly this
costs money that you might not have, but so does a PhD.
Though since you're from Paris or at least France, you should definitely consider Bengio's
Montreal-based group, or LeCun's New York based group. They both speak French and
probably don't mind another Francophone student. Though being Godfathers of the field,
they both are likely swapped with applications so you'll definitely want to distinguish yourself
in some way.
TL;DR: You're not deluded, but you need to be more clever and find ways to stand out.
Consider less prestigious options that are still respectable. If you get a PhD, make it count by
getting it from a top tier lab. Prove your worth with data points that show you have potential.
Best of luck!

Front-tier Research teams, such as FB or Google, require a PhD. Practically, a PhD student is
not necessarily stronger than master student. Yet a PhD student should know how to write
academic papers and conduct research without supervision, which is more important for
research groups. When you see the terms "applied" in the position description, it could
indicate that a Master should be enough. Last comment, like everything, connections really
matters, and usually publishing papers, and attend to front tier conferences helps to get
those kind of connections.
