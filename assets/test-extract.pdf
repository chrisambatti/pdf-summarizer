To  
JOHN LOMAS 
who asked me to write it 

Preface 
I  am  indebted  for  many  valuable  criticisms  to  Professor  C.  D.  
Broad  and  Dr  C.  P.  Snow,  each  of  whom  read  my  original  
manuscript.  I  have  incorporated  the  substance  of  nearly  all  of  
their  suggestions  in  my  text,  and  have  so  removed  a  good  many  
crudities and obscurities. 
In  one  case,  I  have  dealt  with  them  differently.  My  §28  is  
based on a short article which I contributed to Eureka (the journal 
of  the  Cambridge  Archimedean  Society)  early  in  the  year,  and  I  
found it impossible to remodel what I had written so recently and 
with  so  much  care.  Also,  if  I  had  tried  to  meet  such  important  
criticisms  seriously,  I  should  have  had  to  expand  this  section  so  
much  as  to  destroy  the  whole  balance  of  my  essay.  I  have  
therefore left it unaltered, but have added a short statement of the 
chief points made by my critics in a note at the end.

It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to 
find   himself   writing   about   mathematics.   The   function   of   a   
mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add 
to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathema-
ticians  have  done.  Statesmen  despise  publicists,  painters  despise  
art-critics,  and  physiologists,  physicists,  or  mathematicians  have  
usually  similar  feelings:  there  is  no  scorn  more  profound,  or  on  
the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the 
men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for 
second-rate minds. 
I  can  remember  arguing  this  point  once  in  one  of  the  few  
serious conversations that I ever had with Housman. Housman, in 
his  Leslie  Stephen  lecture  The  Name  and  Nature  of  Poetry,  had  
denied very emphatically that he was a ‘critic’; but he had denied 
it  in  what  seemed  to  me  a  singularly  perverse  way,  and  had  
expressed  an  admiration  for  literary  criticism  which  startled  and  
scandalized me. 
He  had  begun  with  a  quotation  from  his  inaugural  lecture,  
delivered twenty-two years before— 
Whether  the  faculty  of  literary  criticism  is  the  best  
gift  that  Heaven  has  in  its  treasures,  I  cannot  say;  but  
Heaven  seems  to  think  so,  for  assuredly  it  is  the  gift  
most  charily  bestowed.  Orators  and  poets...,  if  rare  in  
comparison  with  blackberries,  are  commoner  than  re-
turns  of  Halley's  comet:  literary  critics  are  less  com-
mon... 
And he had continued— 
In  these  twenty-two  years  I  have  improved  in  some  
respects  and  deteriorated  in  others,  but  I  have  not  so  
much  improved  as  to  become  a  literary  critic,  nor  so  
much deteriorated as to fancy that I have become one. 

 
2
It  had  seemed  to  me  deplorable  that  a  great  scholar  and  a  fine  
poet  should  write  like  this,  and,  finding  myself  next  to  him  in  
Hall  a  few  weeks  later,  I  plunged  in  and  said  so.  Did  he  really  
mean what he had said to be taken very seriously? Would the life 
of  the  best  of  critics  really  have  seemed  to  him  comparable  with  
that of a scholar and a poet? We argued the questions all through 
dinner, and I think that finally he agreed with me. I must not seem 
to  claim  a  dialectical  triumph  over  a  man  who  can  no  longer  
contradict me, but ‘Perhaps not entirely’ was, in the end, his reply 
to the first question, and ‘Probably no’ to the second. 
There  may  have  been  some  doubt  about  Housman's  feelings,  
and  I  do  not  wish  to  claim  him  as  on  my  side;  but  there  is  no  
doubt at all about the feelings of men of science, and I share them 
fully.  If  then  I  find  myself  writing,  not  mathematics,  but  ‘about’  
mathematics,  it  is  a  confession  of  weakness,  for  which  I  may  
rightly  be  scorned  or  pitied  by  younger  and  more  vigorous  
mathematicians.  I  write  about  mathematics  because,  like  any  
other  mathematician  who  has  passed  sixty,  I  have  no  longer  the  
freshness  of  mind,  the  energy,  or  the  patience  to  carry  on  
effectively with my proper job. 
2 
I  propose  to  put  forward  an  apology  for  mathematics;  and  I  may  
be  told  that  it  needs  none,  since  there  are  now  few  studies  more  
generally  recognized,  for  good  reasons  or  bad,  as  profitable  and  
praiseworthy.  This  may  be  true:  indeed  it  is  probable,  since  the  
sensational   triumphs   of   Einstein,   that   stellar   astronomy   and   
atomic  physics  are  the  only  sciences  which  stand  higher  in  
popular  estimation.  A  mathematician  need  not  now  consider  
himself  on  the  defensive.  He  does  not  have  to  meet  the  sort  of  
opposition  describe  by  Bradley  in  the  admirable  defence  of  
metaphysics  which  forms  the  introduction  to  Appearance  and  
Reality. 

 
3
A metaphysician, says Bradley, will be told that ‘metaphysical 
knowledge  is  wholly  impossible’,  or  that  ‘even  if  possible  to  a  
certain  degree,  it  is  practically  no  knowledge  worth  the  name’.  
‘The  same  problems,’  he  will  hear,  ‘the  same  disputes,  the  same  
sheer failure. Why not abandon it and come out? Is there nothing 
else  worth  your  labour?’  There  is  no  one  so  stupid  as  to  use  this  
sort  of  language  about  mathematics.  The  mass  of  mathematical  
truth  is  obvious  and  imposing;  its  practical  applications,  the  
bridges  and  steam-engines  and  dynamos,  obtrude  themselves  on  
the dullest imagination. The public does not need to be convinced 
that there is something in mathematics. 
All this is in its way very comforting to mathematicians, but it 
is hardly possible for a genuine mathematician to be content with 
it.  Any  genuine  mathematician  must  feel  that  it  is  not  on  these  
crude  achievements  that  the  real  case  for  mathematics  rests,  that  
the   popular   reputation   of   mathematics   is   based   largely   on   
ignorance  and  confusion,  and  there  is  room  for  a  more  rational  
defence. At any rate, I am disposed to try to make one. It should 
be a simpler task than Bradley’s difficult apology. 
I shall ask, then, why is it really worth while to make a serious 
study  of  mathematics?  What  is  the  proper  justification  of  a  
mathematician’s life? And my answers will be, for the most part, 
such as are expected from a mathematician: I think that it is worth 
while,  that  there  is  ample  justification.  But  I  should  say  at  once  
that my defence of mathematics will be a defence of myself, and 
that  my  apology  is  bound  to  be  to  some  extent  egotistical.  I  
should  not  think  it  worth  while  to  apologize  for  my  subject  if  I  
regarded myself as one of its failures. 
Some egotism of this sort is inevitable, and I do not feel that it 
really  needs  justification.  Good  work  is  no  done  by  ‘humble’  
men.  It  is  one  of  the  first  duties  of  a  professor,  for  example,  in  
any  subject,  to  exaggerate  a  little  both  the  importance  of  his  
subject and his own importance in it. A man who is always asking 
‘Is what I do worth while?’ and ‘Am I the right person to do it?’ 

 
4
will  always  be  ineffective  himself  and  a  discouragement  to  
others. He must shut his eyes a little and think a little more of his 
subject and himself than they deserve. This is not too difficult: it 
is  harder  not  to  make  his  subject  and  himself  ridiculous  by  
shutting his eyes too tightly. 
3 
A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities has 
to  distinguish  two  different  questions.  The  first  is  whether  the  
work  which  he  does  is  worth  doing;  and  the  second  is  why  he  
does it, whatever its value may be. The first question is often very 
difficult, and the answer very discouraging, but most people will 
find the second easy enough even then. Their answers, if they are 
honest,  will  usually  take  one  or  other  of  two  forms;  and  the  
second form is a merely a humbler variation of the first, which is 
the only answer we need consider seriously. 
(1)  ‘I  do  what  I  do  because  it  is  the  one  and  only  thing  that  I  
can  do  at  all  well.  I  am  a  lawyer,  or  a  stockbroker,  or  a  profes-
sional cricketer, because I have some real talent for that particular 
job.  I  am  a  lawyer  because  I  have  a  fluent  tongue,  and  am  
interested  in  legal  subtleties;  I  am  a  stockbroker  because  my  
judgment  of  the  markets  is  quick  and  sound;  I  am  a  professional  
cricketer because I can bat unusually well. I agree that it might be 
better to be a poet or a mathematician, but unfortunately I have no 
talent for such pursuits.’ 
I  am  not  suggesting  that  this  is  a  defence  which  can  be  made  
by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But 
it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity, as it can 
by a substantial minority: perhaps five or even ten percent of men 
can  do  something  rather  well.  It  is  a  tiny  minority  who  can  do  
something really  well,  and  the  number  of  men  who  can  do  two  
things  well  is  negligible.  If  a  man  has  any  genuine  talent  he  

 
5
should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate 
it to the full. 
This view was endorsed by Dr Johnson 
When  I  told  him  that  I  had  been  to  see  [his  name-
sake]  Johnson  ride  upon  three  horses,  he  said  ‘Such  a  
man,  sir,  should  be  encouraged,  for  his  performances  
show the extent of the human powers ...’— 
and   similarly   he   would   have   applauded   mountain   climbers,   
channel swimmers, and blindfold chess-players. For my own part, 
I  am  entirely  in  sympathy  with  all  such  attempts  at  remarkable  
achievement.  I  feel  some  sympathy  even  with  conjurors  and  
ventriloquists  and  when  Alekhine  and  Bradman  set  out  to  beat  
records,  I  am  quite  bitterly  disappointed  if  they  fail.  And  here  
both  Dr  Johnson  and  I  find  ourselves  in  agreement  with  the  
public.   As   W.   J.   Turner   has   said   so   truly,   it   is   only   the   
‘highbrows’ (in the unpleasant sense) who do not admire the ‘real 
swells’. 
We  have  of  course  to  take  account  of  the  differences  in  value  
between  different  activities.  I  would  rather  be  a  novelist  or  a  
painter than a statesman of similar rank; and there are many roads 
to fame which most of us would reject as actively pernicious. Yet 
it is seldom that such differences of value will turn the scale in a 
man’s choice of a career, which will almost always be dictated by 
the  limitations  of  his  natural  abilities.  Poetry  is  more  valuable  
than  cricket,  but  Bradman  would  be  a  fool  if  he  sacrificed  his  
cricket in order to write second-rate minor poetry (and I suppose 
that  it  is  unlikely  that  he  could  do  better).  If  the  cricket  were  a  
little less supreme, and the poetry better, then the choice might be 
more  difficult:  I  do  not  know  whether  I  would  rather  have  been  
Victor  Trumper  or  Rupert  Brooke.  It  is  fortunate  that  such  
dilemmas are so seldom. 
I  may  add  that  they  are  particularly  unlikely  to  present  them-
selves to a mathematician. It is usual to exaggerate rather grossly 
the  differences  between  the  mental  processes  of  mathematicians  

 
6
and  other  people,  but  it  is  undeniable  that  a  gift  for  mathematics  
is one of the most specialized talents, and that mathematicians as 
a  class  are  not  particularly  distinguished  for  general  ability  or  
versatility. If a man is in any sense a real mathematician, then it is 
a  hundred  to  one  that  his  mathematics  will  be  far  better  than  
anything  else  he  can  do,  and  that  he  would  be  silly  if  he  surren-
dered any decent opportunity of exercising his one talent in order 
to do undistinguished work in other fields. Such a sacrifice could 
be justified only by economic necessity or age. 
4 
I had better say something here about this question of age, since it 
is  particularly  important  for  mathematicians.  No  mathematician  
should  ever  allow  himself  to  forget  that  mathematics,  more  than  
any other art or science, is a young man's game. To take a simple 
illustration  at  a  comparatively  humble  level,  the  average  age  of  
election  to  the  Royal  Society  is  lowest  in  mathematics.  We  can  
naturally find much more striking illustrations. We may consider, 
for  example,  the  career  of  a  man  who  was  certainly  one  of  the  
world's  three  greatest  mathematicians.  Newton  gave  up  mathe-
matics  at  fifty,  and  had  lost  his  enthusiasm  long  before;  he  had  
recognized  no  doubt  by  the  time  he  was  forty  that  his  greatest  
creative days were over. His greatest idea of all, fluxions and the 
law of gravitation, came to him about 
1666, when he was twenty-
four—'in  those  days  I  was  in  the  prime  of  my  age  for  invention,  
and  minded  mathematics  and  philosophy  more  than  at  any  time  
sine'.  He  made  big  discoveries  until  he  was  nearly  forty  (the  
'elliptic orbit' at thirty-seven), but after that he did little but polish 
and perfect. 
Galois died at twenty-one, Abel at twenty-seven, Ramanujan at 
thirty-three,  Riemann  at  forty.  There  have  been  men  who  have  
done  great  work  a  good  deal  later;  Gauss's  great  memoir  on  
differential geometry was published when he was fifty (though he 

 
7
had had the fundamental ideas ten years before). I do not know an 
instance of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past 
fifty.  If  a  man  of  mature  age  loses  interest  in  and  abandons  
mathematics,  the  loss  is  not  likely  to  be  very  serious  either  for  
mathematics or for himself. 
On the other hand the gain is no more likely to be substantial: 
the  later  records  of  mathematicians  are  not  particularly  encour-
aging. Newton made a quite competent Master of the Mint (when 
he  was  not  quarrelling  with  anybody).  Painlevé  was  a  not  very  
successful  Premier  of  France.  Laplace’s  political  career  was  
highly discreditable, but he is hardly a fair instance since he was 
dishonest  rather  than  incompetent,  and  never  really  ‘gave  up’  
mathematics.  It  is  very  hard  to  find  an  instance  of  a  first-rate  
mathematician  who  has  abandoned  mathematics  and  attained  
first-rate  distinction  in  any  other  field.
1
  There  may  have  been  
young men who would have been first-rate mathematician if they 
had  stuck  in  mathematics,  but  I  have  never  heard  of  a  really  
plausible example. And all this is fully borne out by my very own 
limited  experience.  Every  young  mathematician  of  real  talent  
whom  I  have  known  has  been  faithful  to  mathematics,  and  not  
form  lack  of  ambition  but  from  abundance  of  it;  they  have  all  
recognized  that  there,  if  anywhere,  lay  the  road  to  a  life  of  any  
distinction. 
5 
There  is  also  what  I  call  the  ‘humbler  variation’  of  the  standard  
apology; but I may dismiss this in a very few words. 
(2) ‘There is nothing that I can do particularly well. I do what I 
do because it came my way. I really never had a chance of doing 
anything  else.’  And  this  apology  too  I  accept  as  conclusive.  It  is  
quite  true  that  most  people  can  do  nothing  well.  If  so,  it  matters  
very  little  what  career  they  choose,  and  there  is  really  nothing  
                                                 
1
 Pascal seems the best 

 
8
more to say about it. It is a conclusive reply, but hardly one likely 
to be made by a man with any pride; and I may assume that none 
of us would be content with it. 
6 
It is time to begin thinking about the first question which I put in 
§3,  and  which  is  so  much  more  difficult  than  the  second.  Is  
mathematics,  what  I  and  other  mathematicians  mean  by  mathe-
matics, worth doing; and if so, why? 
I  have  been  looking  again  at  the  first  pages  of  the  inaugural  
lecture which I gave at Oxford in 
1920, where there is an outline 
of  an  apology  for  mathematics.  It  is  very  inadequate  (less  than  a  
couple of page), and is written in a style (a first essay, I suppose, 
in what I then imagined to be the ‘Oxford manner’) of which I am 
not  now  particularly  proud;  but  I  still  feel  that,  however  much  
development it may need, it contains the essentials of the matter. I 
will resume what I said then, as a preface to a fuller discussion. 
(1) I began by laying stress on the harmlessness of mathemat-
ics—‘the  study  of  mathematics  is,  if  an  unprofitable,  a  perfectly  
harmless  and  innocent  occupation’.  I  shall  stick  to  that,  but  
obviously it will need a good deal of expansion and explanation. 
Is mathematics ‘unprofitable’? In some ways, plainly, it is not; 
for  example,  it  gives  great  pleasure  to  quite  a  large  number  of  
people.  I  was  thinking  of  ‘profit’,  however,  in  a  narrower  sense.  
Is mathematics ‘useful’, directly useful, as other sciences such as 
chemistry  and  physiology  are?  This  is  not  an  altogether  easy  or  
uncontroversial  question,  and  I  shall  ultimately  say  No,  though  
some  mathematicians,  and  some  outsiders,  would  no  doubt  say  
Yes.  And  is  mathematics  ‘harmless’?  Again  the  answer  is  not  
obvious,  and  the  question  is  one  which  I  should  have  in  some  
ways  preferred  to  avoid,  since  it  raises  the  whole  problem  of  the  
effect of science on war. Is mathematics harmless, in the sense in 

 
9
which, for example, chemistry plainly is not? I shall have to come 
back to both these questions later. 
(2) I went on to say that ‘the scale of the universe is large and, 
if  we  are  wasting  our  time,  the  waste  of  the  lives  of  a  few  
university dons is no such overwhelming catastrophe’; and here I 
may  seem  to  be  adopting,  or  affecting,  the  pose  of  exaggerated  
humility  which  I  repudiated  a  moment  ago.  I  am  sure  that  that  
was  not  what  was  really  in  my  mind:  I  was  trying  to  say  in  a  
sentence  that  which  I  have  said  at  much  greater  length  in  §3.  I  
was  assuming  that  we  dons  really  had  our  little  talents,  and  that  
we  could  hardly  be  wrong  if  we  did  our  best  to  cultivate  them  
further. 
(3)  Finally  (in  what  seem  to  me  now  some  rather  painfully  
rhetorical sentences) I emphasized the permanence of mathemati-
cal achievement— 
What we do may be small, but it has a certain char-
acter of permanence; and to have produced anything of 
the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of 
verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done some-
thing utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of 
men. 
And— 
In these days of conflict between ancient and modern 
studies, there must surely be something to be said for a 
study  which  did  not  begin  with  Pythagoras,  and  will  
not end with Einstein, but is the oldest and the youngest 
of all. 
All  this  is  ‘rhetoric’;  but  the  substance  of  it  seems  to  me  still  to  
ring true, and I can expand on it at once without prejudicing any 
of the other questions which I am leaving open. 

 
10
7 
I shall assume that I am writing for readers who are full, or have 
in the past been full, of a proper spirit of ambition. A man’s first 
duty, a young man’s at any rate, is to be ambitious. Ambition is a 
noble passion which may legitimately take many forms; there was 
something  noble  in  the  ambitions  of  Attila  or  Napoleon;  but  the  
noblest  ambition  is  that  of  leaving  behind  something  of  perma-
nent value— 
Here, on the level sand, 
Between the sea and land, 
What shall I build or write 
Against the fall of night? 
 
Tell me of runes to grave 
That hold the bursting wave, 
Or bastions to design, 
For longer date than mine. 
Ambition has been the driving force behind nearly all the best 
work   of   the   world.   In   particular,   practically   all   substantial   
contributions  to  human  happiness  have  been  made  by  ambitious  
men.  To  take  two  famous  examples,  were  not  Lister  and  Pasteur  
ambitions?  Or,  on  a  humbler  level,  King  Gillette  and  William  
Willet; and who in recent times have contributed more to human 
comfort than they? 
Physiology  provides  particularly  good  examples,  just  because  
it  is  so  obviously  a  ‘beneficial’  study.  We  must  guard  against  a  
fallacy   common   among   apologist   of   science,   the   fallacy   of   
supposing  that  the  men  whose  work  most  benefits  humanity  are  
thinking  much  of  that  while  they  do  it,  that  physiologists,  for  
example,   have   particularly   noble   souls.   A   physiologist   may   
indeed  be  glad  to  remember  that  his  work  will  benefit  mankind,  
but the motives which provide the force and the inspiration for it 

 
11
are  indistinguishable  form  those  of  a  classical  scholar  or  a  
mathematician. 
There are many highly respected motives which may lead men 
to  prosecute  research,  but  three  which  are  much  more  important  
than  the  rest.  The  first  (without  which  the  rest  must  come  to  
nothing)  is  intellectual  curiosity,  desire  to  know  the  truth.  Then,  
professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one’s performance, 
the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his 
work  is  unworthy  of  his  talent.  Finally,  ambition,  desire  for  
reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which 
it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work, 
that  you  have  added  to  the  happiness  or  alleviated  the  sufferings  
of others, but that will not be why you did it. So if a mathemati-
cian, or a chemist, or even a physiologist, were to tell me that the 
driving   force   in   his   work   had   been   the   desired   to   benefit   
humanity,  then  I  should  not  believe  him  (nor  should  I  think  the  
better  of  him  if  I  did).  His  dominant  motives  have  been  those  
which  I  have  stated,  and  in  which,  surely,  there  is  nothing  of  
which any decent man need be ashamed. 
8 
If  intellectual  curiosity,  professional  pride,  and  ambition  are  the  
dominant  incentives  to  research,  then  assuredly  no  one  has  a  
fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. His subject 
is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such 
odd  pranks.  It  has  the  most  elaborate  and  the  most  fascinating  
technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer 
professional    skill.    Finally,    as    history    proves    abundantly,    
mathematical  achievement,  whatever  its  intrinsic  worth,  is  the  
most enduring of all. 
We  can  see  this  even  in  semi-historic  civilizations.  The  Baby-
lonian  and  Assyrian  civilizations  have  perished;  Hammurabi,  
Sargon,  and  Nebuchadnezzar  are  empty  names;  yet  Babylonian  

 
12
mathematics is still interesting, and the Babylonian scale of 60 is 
still  used  in  astronomy.  But  of  course  the  crucial  case  is  that  of  
the Greeks. 
The Greeks were the first mathematicians who are still ‘real’ to 
us  to-day.  Oriental  mathematics  may  be  an  interesting  curiosity,  
but Greek mathematics is the real thing. The Greeks first spoke a 
language   which   modern   mathematicians   can   understand:   as   
Littlewood  said  to  me  once,  they  are  not  clever  schoolboys  or  
‘scholarship  candidates’,  but  ‘Fellows  of  another  college’.  So  
Greek  mathematics  is  ‘permanent’,  more  permanent  even  than  
Greek  literature.  Archimedes  will  be  remembered  when  Aeschy-
lus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do 
not. ‘Immortality’ may be a silly word, but probably a mathema-
tician has the best chance of whatever it may mean. 
Nor need he fear very seriously that the future will be unjust to 
him.  Immortality  is  often  ridiculous  or  cruel:  few  of  us  would  
have chosen to be Og or Ananias or Gallio. Even in mathematics, 
history  sometimes  plays  strange  tricks;  Rolle  figures  in  the  text-
books  of  elementary  calculus  as  if  he  had  been  a  mathematician  
like Newton; Farey is immortal because he failed to understand a 
theorem which Haros had proved perfectly fourteen years before; 
the  names  of  five  worthy  Norwegians  still  stand  in  Abel’s  Life, 
just for one act of conscientious imbecility, dutifully performed at 
the expense of their country’s greatest man. But on the whole the 
history  of  science  is  fair,  and  this  is  particularly  true  in  mathe-
matics.  No  other  subject  has  such  clear-cut  or  unanimously  
accepted standards, and the men who are remembered are almost 
always the men who merit it. Mathematical fame, if you have the 
cash  to  pay  for  it,  is  one  of  the  soundest  and  steadiest  of  invest-
ments.

All this is very comforting for dons, and especially for professors 
of   mathematics.   It   is   sometimes   suggested,   by   lawyers   or   
politicians or business men, that an academic career is one sought 
mainly  by  cautious  and  unambitious  persons  who  care  primarily  
for comfort and security. The reproach is quite misplaced. A don 
surrenders  something,  and  in  particular  the  chance  of  making  
large  sums  of  money—it  is  very  hard  for  a  professor  to  make  
£2000  a  year;  and  security  of  tenure  is  naturally  one  of  the  
considerations which make this particular surrender easy. That is 
not why Housman would have refused to be Lord Simon or Lord 
Beaverbrook. He would have rejected their careers because of his 
ambition,  because  he  would  have  scorned  to  be  a  man  forgotten  
in twenty years. 
Yet how painful it is to feel that, with all these advantages, one 
may  fail.  I  can  remember  Bertrand  Russell  telling  me  of  a  
horrible dream. He was in the top floor of the University Library, 
about A.D. 
2100. A library assistant was going round the shelves 
carrying  an  enormous  bucket,  taking  down  books,  glancing  at  
them,  restoring  them  to  the  shelves  or  dumping  them  into  the  
bucket.  At  last  he  came  to  three  large  volumes  which  Russell  
could  recognize  as  the  last  surviving  copy  of  Principia  Mathe-
matica.  He  took  down  one  of  the  volumes,  turned  over  a  few  
pages,  seemed  puzzled  for  a  moment  by  the  curious  symbolism,  
closed the volume, balanced it in his hand and hesitated.... 
10 
A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. 
If  his  patterns  are  more  permanent  than  theirs,  it  is  because  they  
are  made  with  ideas.  A  painter  makes  patterns  with  shapes  and  
colours,  a  poet  with  words.  A  painting  may  embody  and  ‘idea’,  
but  the  idea  is  usually  commonplace  and  unimportant.  In  poetry,  

 
14
ideas  count  for  a  good  deal  more;  but,  as  Housman  insisted,  the  
importance of ideas in poetry is habitually exaggerated: ‘I cannot 
satisfy  myself  that  there  are  any  such  things  as  poetical  ideas....  
Poetry is no the thing said but a way of saying it.’ 
Not all the water in the rough rude sea 
Can wash the balm from an anointed King. 
Could  lines  be  better,  and  could  ideas  be  at  once  more  trite  and  
more  false?  The  poverty  of  the  ideas  seems  hardly  to  affect  the  
beauty of the verbal pattern. A mathematician, on the other hand, 
has  no  material  to  work  with  but  ideas,  and  so  his  patterns  are  
likely to last longer, since ideas wear less with time than words. 
The  mathematician’s  patterns,  like  the  painter’s  or  the  poet’s  
must be beautiful; the ideas like the colours or the words, must fit 
together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no 
permanent  place  in  the  world  for  ugly  mathematics.  And  here  I  
must deal with a misconception which is still widespread (though 
probably  much  less  so  now  than  it  was  twenty  years  ago),  what  
Whitehead  has  called  the  ‘literary  superstition’  that  love  of  an  
aesthetic  appreciation  of  mathematics  is  ‘a  monomania  confined  
to a few eccentrics in each generation’. 
It  would  be  quite  difficult  now  to  find  an  educated  man  quite  
insensitive to the aesthetic appeal of mathematics. It may be very 
hard  to  define  mathematical  beauty,  but  that is just as true of 
beauty of any kind—we may not know quite what we mean by a 
beautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognizing one 
when we read it. Even Professor Hogben, who is out to minimize 
at  all  costs  the  importance  of  the  aesthetic  element  in  mathemat-
ics,  does  not  venture  to  deny  its  reality.  ‘There  are,  to  be  sure,  
individuals  for  whom  mathematics  exercises  a  coldly  impersonal  
attraction....  The  aesthetic  appeal  of  mathematics  may  be  very  
real  for  a  chosen  few.’  But  they  are  ‘few’,  he  suggests,  and  they  
feel  ‘coldly’  (and  are  really  rather  ridiculous  people,  who  live  in  
silly little university towns sheltered from the fresh breezes of the 

 
15
wide  open  spaces).  In  this  he  is  merely  echoing  Whitehead’s  
‘literary superstition’. 
The  fact  is  that  there  are  few  more  ‘popular’  subjects  than  
mathematics.  Most  people  have  some  appreciation  of  mathemat-
ics,  just  as  most  people  can  enjoy  a  pleasant  tune;  and  there  are  
probably  more  people  really  interested  in  mathematics  than  in  
music.  Appearances  suggest  the  contrary,  but  there  are  easy  
explanations. Music can be used to stimulate mass emotion, while 
mathematics  cannot;  and  musical  incapacity  is  recognized  (no  
doubt rightly) as mildly discreditable, whereas most people are so 
frightened  of  the  name  of  mathematics  that  they  are  ready,  quite  
unaffectedly, to exaggerate their own mathematical stupidity. 
A very little reflection is enough to expose the absurdity of the 
‘literary superstition’. There are masses of chess-players in every 
civilized    country—in    Russia,    almost    the    whole    educated    
population;  and  every  chess-player  can  recognize  and  appreciate  
a  ‘beautiful’  game  or  problem.  Yet  a  chess  problem  is  simply  an  
exercise   in   pure   mathematics   (a   game   not   entirely,   since   
psychology also plays a part), and everyone who calls a problem 
‘beautiful’  is  applauding  mathematical  beauty,  even  if  it  is  a  
beauty  of  a  comparatively  lowly  kind.  Chess  problems  are  the  
hymn-tunes of mathematics. 
We may learn the same lesson, at a lower level but for a wider 
public,  from  bridge,  or  descending  farther,  from  the  puzzle  
columns  of  the  popular  newspapers.  Nearly  all  their  immense  
popularity  is  a  tribute  to  the  drawing  power  of  rudimentary  
mathematics,  and  the  better  makers  of  puzzles,  such  as  Dudeney  
or ‘Caliban’, use very little else. They know their business: what 
the public wants is a little intellectual ‘kick’, and nothing else has 
quite the kick of mathematics. 
I  might  add  that  there  is  nothing  in  the  world  which  pleases  
even  famous  men  (and  men  who  have  used  quite  disparaging  
words  about  mathematics)  quite  so  much  as  to  discover,  or  
rediscover,  a  genuine  mathematical  theorem.  Herbert  Spencer  

 
16
republished  in  his  autobiography  a  theorem  about  circles  which  
he  proved  when  he  was  twenty  (not  knowing  that  it  had  been  
proved  over  two  thousand  years  before  by  Plato).  Professor  
Soddy  is  a  more  recent  and  more  striking  example  (but  his 
theorem really is his own)

A  chess  problem  is  genuine  mathematics,  but  it  is  in  some  way  
‘trivial’  mathematics.  However  ingenious  and  intricate,  however  
original  and  surprising  the  moves,  there  is  something  essential  
lacking.  Chess  problems  are  unimportant.  The  best  mathematics  
is serious  as  well  as  beautiful—‘important’  if  you  like,  but  the  
word  is  very  ambiguous,  and  ‘serious’  expresses  what  I  mean  
much better. 
I am not thinking of the ‘practical’ consequences of mathemat-
ics. I have to return to that later: at present I will say only that if a 
chess problem is, in the crude sense, ‘useless’, then that is equally 
true of most of the best mathematics; that very little of mathemat-
ics  is  useful  practically,  and  that  that  little  is  comparatively  dull.  
The  ‘seriousness’  of  a  mathematical  theorem  lies,  not  in  its  
practical  consequences,  which  are  usually  negligible,  but  in  the  
significance of the mathematical ideas which it connects. We may 
say, roughly, that a mathematical idea is ‘significant’ if it can be 
connected,   in   a   natural   and   illuminating   way,   with   a   large   
complex of other mathematical ideas.  Thus a serious mathemati-
cal theorem, a theorem which connects significant ideas, is likely 
to  lead  to  important  advance  in  mathematics  itself  and  even  in  
other  sciences.  No  chess  problem  has  ever  affected  the  general  
development  of  scientific  though:  Pythagoras,  Newton,  Einstein  
have in their times changed its whole direction. 
The  seriousness  of  a  theorem,  of  course,  does  not  lie  in  its  
consequences,  which  are  merely  the  evidence  for  its  seriousness.

Shakespeare  had  an  enormous  influence  on  the  development  of  
the  English  language,  Otway  next  to  none,  but  that  is  not  why  
Shakespeare  was  the  better  poet.  He  was  the  better  poet  because  
he wrote much better poetry. The inferiority of the chess problem, 
like  that  of  Otway’s  poetry,  lies  not  in  its  consequences  in  its  
content. 
There is one more points which I shall dismiss very shortly, not 
because it is uninteresting but because it is difficult, and because I 
have  no  qualifications  for  any  serious  discussion  in  aesthetics.  
The beauty of a mathematical theorem depends a great deal on its 
seriousness, as even in poetry the beauty of a line may depend to 
some  extent  on  the  significance  of  the  ideas  which  it  contains.  I  
quoted  two  lines  of  Shakespeare  as  an  example  of  the  sheer  
beauty of a verbal pattern, but 
After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well 
seems  still  more  beautiful.  The  pattern  is  just  as  fine,  and  in  this  
case  the  ideas  have  significance  and  the  thesis  is  sound,  so  that  
our  emotions  are  stirred  much  more  deeply.  The  ideas  do  matter  
to  the  pattern,  even  in  poetry,  and  much  more,  naturally,  in  
mathematics; but I must not try the argue the question seriously. 
12 
It  will  be  clear  by  now  that,  if  we  are  to  have  any  chance  of  
making progress, I must produce example of ‘real’ mathematical 
theorems,  theorems  which  every  mathematician  will  admit  to  be  
first-rate.  And  here  I  am  very  handicapped  by  the  restrictions  
under which I am writing. On the one hand my examples must be 
very  simple,  and  intelligible  to  a  reader  who  has  no  specialized  
mathematical  knowledge;  no  elaborate  preliminary  explanations  
must be needs; and a reader must be able to follow the proofs as 
well  as  the  enunciations.  These  conditions  exclude,  for  instance,  
many  of  the  most  beautiful  theorems  of  the  theory  of  numbers,  
such  as  Fermat’s  ‘two  square’  theorem  on  the  law  of  quadratic  

 
18
reciprocity. And on the other hand my examples should be drawn 
from  the  ‘pukka’  mathematics,  the  mathematics  of  the  working  
professional  mathematician;  and  this  condition  excludes  a  good  
deal  which  it  would  be  comparatively  easy  to  make  intelligible  
but which trespasses on logic and mathematical philosophy. 
I  can  hardly  do  better  than  go  back  to  the  Greeks.  I  will  state  
and  prove  two  of  the  famous  theorems  of  Greek  mathematics.  
They are ‘simple’ theorems, simple both in idea and in execution, 
but  there  is  no  doubt  at  all  about  their  being  theorems  of  the  
highest  class.  Each  is  as  fresh  and  significant  as  when  it  has  
discovered—two  thousand  years  have  not  written  a  wrinkle  on  
either of them. Finally, both the statements and the proofs can be 
mastered in an hour by any intelligent reader, however slender his 
mathematical equipment. 
1.   The first is Euclid’s
3
 proof of the existence of an infinity of 
prime numbers. 
The prime numbers or primes are the numbers 
(A) 
...,29,23,19,17,13,11,7,5,3,2 
which cannot be resolved into smaller factors
4
. Thus 37 and  317 
are  prime.  The  primes  are  the  material  out  of  which  all  numbers  
are built up by multiplication: thus 
37332666⋅⋅⋅=. Every number 
which  is  not  prime  itself  is  divisible  by  at  least  one  prime  
(usually,  of  course,  by  several).  We  have  to  prove  that  there  are  
infinitely many primes, i.e. that the series (A) never comes to an 
end. 
Let us suppose that it does, and that 
P,,5,3,2... 
is the complete series (so that 
P is the largest prime); and let us, 
on this hypothesis, consider the number 
Q defined by the formula 
1)532(+⋅⋅⋅⋅=PQ". 
                                                 
3
 Elements IX 20. The real origin of many theorems in the Elements is obscure, and there 
seems to be no particular reason for supposing that this one is not Euclid’s own. 
4
 There are technical reasons for not counting 1 as a prime. 

 
19
It  is  plain  that  Q  is  not  divisible  by  and  of  P,,5,3,2...;  for  it  
leaves   the   remainder   1   when   divided   by   any   one   of   these   
numbers.  But,  if  not  itself  prime,  it  is  divisible  by  some  prime,  
and  therefore  there  is  a  prime  (which  may  be  
Q  itself)  greater  
than any of them. This contradicts our hypothesis, that there is no 
prime greater than 
P; and therefore this hypothesis is false. 
The proof is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absur-
dum,  which  Euclid  loved  so  much,  is  one  of  a  mathematician’s  
finest weapons
5
. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a 
chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but 
a mathematician offers the game. 
13 
2.   My second example is Pythagoras’s
6
 proof of the ‘irration-
ality’ of 
2. A ‘rational number’ is fraction 
b
a
, where a and bare 
integers:  we  may  suppose  that  
a  and  b have no common factor, 
since  if  they  had  we  could  remove  it.  To  say  that  ‘
2  is  irra-
tional’ is merely another way of saying that 2 cannot be expressed 
in the form 
2
⎟
⎠
⎞
⎜
⎝
⎛
b
a
; and this is the same as saying that the equation 
(B) 
22
2ba= 
cannot  be  satisfied  by  integral  values  of  
a  and  bwhich  have  no  
common factor. This is a theorem of pure arithmetic, which does 
not demand any knowledge of ‘irrational numbers’ or depend on 
any theory about their nature. 
We argue again by reductio ad absurdum; we suppose that (B) 
is  true,  
a  and  b  being  integers  without  any  common  factor.  It  
follows from (B) that 
2
a is even (since 
2
2b is divisible by 2), and 
                                                 
5
 The proof can be arranged so as to avoid a reductio, and logicians of some schools would 
prefer that it should be. 
6
 The proof traditionally ascribed to Pythagoras, and certainly a product of his school. The 
theorem occurs, in a much more general form, in Euclid (Elements X 9). 

 
20
therefore  that  a  is  even  (since  the  square  of  an  odd  number  is  
odd). If 
a is even then 
(C) 
ca2= 
for some integral value of 
c; and therefore 
 
2222
4)2(2ccab=== 
or 
(D) 
22
2cb= 
Hence 
2
b  is  even,  and  therefore  (for  the  same  reason  as  before)  
bis  even.  That  is  to  say,  a  and  b  are  both  even,  and  so  have  
common  factor  
2.  This  contradicts  our  hypothesis,  and  therefore  
the hypothesis is false. 
It  follows  from  Pythagoras’s  theorem  that  the  diagonal  of  a  
square  is  incommensurable  with  the  side  (that  their  ratio  is  not  a  
rational  number,  that  there  is  no  unit  of  which  both  are  integral  
multiples).  For  if  we  take  the  side  as  our  unit  of  length,  and  the  
length of the diagonal is 
d, then, by a very familiar theorem also 
ascribed to Pythagoras
7
, 
 
211
222
=+=d 
So that 
d cannot be a rational number. 
I could quote any number of fine theorems from the theory of 
numbers  whose  meaning  anyone  can  understand.  For  example,  
there  is  what  is  called  ‘the  fundamental  theorem  of  arithmetic’,  
that  any  integer  can  be  resolved,  in  one  way  only,  into  a  product  
of primes. Thus 
37332666⋅⋅⋅=, and there is no other decomposi-
tion; it is impossible that 
29112666⋅⋅=  or  that  73178913⋅=⋅  (and  
we can see so without working out the products). This theorem is, 
as  its  name  implies,  the  foundation  of  higher  arithmetic;  but  the  
proof,  although  not  ‘difficult’,  requires  a  certain  amount  of  
preface and might be found tedious by an unmathematical reader. 
Another   famous   and   beautiful   theorem   is   Fermat’s   ‘two   
square’ theorem. The primes may (if we ignore the special prime 
2) be arranged in two classes; the primes 
 
...,41,37,29,17,13,5

21
which leave remainder 1 when divided by 4, and the primes 
 
...,31,23,19,11,7,3 
which  leave  remainder  3.  All  the  primes  of  the  first  class,  and  
none  of  the  second,  can  be  expressed  as  the  sum  of  two  integral  
squares: thus 
 
;5229,4117

2222

but 3, 7, 11, and 19 are not expressible in this way (as the reader 
may  check  by  trial).  This  is  Fermat’s  theorem,  which  is  ranked,  
very justly, as one of the finest of arithmetic. Unfortunately, there 
is  no  proof  within  the  comprehension  of  anybody  but  a  fairly  
expert mathematician. 
There are also beautiful theorems in the ‘theory of aggregates’ 
(Mengenlehre),    such    as    Cantor’s    theorem    of    the    ‘non-
enumerability’  of  the  continuum.  Here  there  is  just  the  opposite  
difficulty. The proof is easy enough, when once the language has 
been  mastered,  but  considerable  explanation  is  necessary  before  
the meaning  of  the  theorem  becomes  clear.  So  I  will  not  try  to  
give more examples. Those which I have given are test cases, and 
a  reader  who  cannot  appreciate  them  is  unlikely  to  appreciate  
anything in mathematics. 
I  said  that  a  mathematician  was  a  maker  of  patterns  of  ideas,  
and  that  beauty  and  seriousness  were  the  criteria  by  which  his  
patterns  should  be  judged.  I  can  hardly  believe  that  anyone  who  
has understood the two theorems will dispute that they pass these 
tests.   If   we   compare   them   with   Dudeney’s   most   ingenious   
puzzles, or the finest chess problems the masters of that art have 
composed, their superiority in both respects stands out: there is an 
unmistakable  difference  of  class.  They  are  much  more  serious,  
and  also  much  more  beautiful:  can  define,  a  little  more  closely,  
where their superiority lies? 

 
22
14 
In the first place, the superiority of the mathematical theorems in 
seriousness  is  obvious  and  overwhelming.  The  chess  problem  is  
the  product  of  an  ingenious  but  very  limited  complex  of  ideas,  
which  do  not  differ  from  one  another  very  fundamentally  and  
have no external repercussions. We should think in the same way 
if chess had never been invented, whereas the theorems of Euclid 
and Pythagoras have influenced thought profoundly, even outside 
mathematics. 
Thus  Euclid’s  theorem  is  vital  for  the  whole  structure  of  
arithmetic. The primes are the raw material out of which we have 
to build arithmetic, and Euclid’s theorem assures us that we have 
plenty of material for the task. But the theorem of Pythagoras has 
wider applications and provides a better text. 
We should observe first that Pythagoras’s argument is capable 
of far reaching extension, and can be applied, with little change of 
principle to very wide classes of ‘irrationals’. We can prove very 
similarly (as Theaetetus seems to have done) that 
 
17,13,11,5,3 
are irrational, or (going beyond Theaetetus) that 
3
2 and 
3
17 are 
irrational
8
. 
Euclid’s theorem tells us that we have a good supply of mate-
rial  for  the  construction  of  a  coherent  arithmetic  of  the  integers.  
Pythagoras’s  theorem  and  its  extensions  tell  us  that,  when  we  
have  constructed  this  arithmetic,  it  will  not  prove  sufficient  for  
our  needs,  since  there  will  be  many  magnitudes  which  obtrude  
themselves  upon  our  attention  and  which  it  will  be  unable  to  
measure:  the  diagonal  of  the  square  is  merely  the  most  obvious  
example.   The   profound   importance   of   this   discovery   was   
recognized at once by the Greek mathematicians. They had begun 
                                                 
8
 See Ch. IV of Hardy and Wright’s Introduction to the Theory of Numbers, where there are 
discussions of different generalizations of Pythagoras’s argument, and of a historical 
puzzled about Theaetetus. 

 
23
by assuming (in accordance, I suppose, with the ‘natural’ dictates 
of  ‘common  sense’)  that  all  magnitudes  of  the  same  kind  are  
commensurable, that any two lengths, for example, are multiples 
of  some  common  unit,  and  they  had  constructed  a  theory  of  
proportion  based  on  this  assumption.  Pythagoras’s  discovery  
exposed  the  unsoundness  of  this  foundation,  and  led  to  the  
construction  of  the  much  more  profound  theory  of  Eudoxus  
which  is  set  out  in  the  fifth  book  of  the  Elements,  and  which  is  
regarded  by  many  modern  mathematicians  as  the  finest  achieve-
ment  of  Greek  mathematics.  The  theory  is  astonishingly  modern  
in  spirit,  and  may  be  regarded  as  the  beginning  of  the  modern  
theory of irrational number, which has revolutionized mathemati-
cal analysis and had much influence on recent philosophy. 
There  is  no  doubt  at  all,  then,  of  the  ‘seriousness’  of  either  
theorem.  It  is  therefore  the  better  worth  remarking  that  neither  
theorem  has  the  slightest  ‘practical’  importance.  In  practical  
application  we  are  concerned  only  with  comparatively  small  
numbers;  only  stellar  astronomy  and  atomic  physics  deal  with  
‘large’   numbers,   and   they   have   very   little   more   practical   
importance, as yet, than the most abstract pure mathematics. I do 
not know what is the highest degree of accuracy ever useful to an 
engineer—we  shall  be  very  generous  if  we  say  ten  significant  
figures. Then

can  be  perfectly  happy  without  the  rest.  So  much  for  Euclid’s  
theorem; and, as regards Pythagoras’s, it is obvious that irration-
als  are  uninteresting  to  an  engineer,  since  he  is  concerned  only  
with approximations, and all approximations are rational.

A  ‘serious’  theorem  is  a  theorem  which  contains  ‘significant’  
ideas,  and  I  suppose  that  I  ought  to  try  to  analyse  a  little  more  
closely the qualities which make a mathematical idea significant. 
This  is  very  difficult,  and  it  is  unlikely that any analysis which I 
can  give  will  be  very  valuable.  We  can  recognize  a  ‘significant’  
idea  when  we  see  it,  as  we  can  those  which  occur  in  my  two  
standard  theorems;  but  this  power  of  recognition  requires  a  high  
degree of mathematical sophistication, and of that familiarity with 
mathematical  ideas  which  comes  only  from  many  years  spent  in  
their  company.  So  I  must  attempt  some  sort  of  analysis;  and  it  
should  be  possible  to  make  one  which,  however  inadequate,  is  
sound  and  intelligible  so  far  as  it  goes.  There  are  two  things  at  
any  rate  which  seem  essential,  a  certain  generality  and  a  certain  
depth; but neither quality is easy to define at all precisely. 
A   significant   mathematical   idea,   a   serious   mathematical   
theorem, should be ‘general’ in some such sense as this. The idea 
should  be  one  which  is  a  constituent  in  many  mathematical  
constructs,  which  is  used  in  the  proof  of  theorems  of  many  
different kinds. The theorem should be one which, even if stated 
originally  (like  Pythagoras’s  theorem)  in  a  quite  special  form,  is  
capable of considerable extension and is typical of a whole class 
of  theorems  of  its  kind.  The  relations  revealed  by  the  proof  
should  be  such  as  to  connect  many  different  mathematical  ideas.  
All this is very vague, and subject to many reservations. But it is 
easy enough to see that a theorem is unlikely to be serious when it 
lacks   these   qualities   conspicuously;   we   have   only   to   take   
examples   from   the   isolated   curiosities   in   which   arithmetic   
abounds.  I  take  two,  almost  at   random,   from   Rouse   Ball’s

These  are  odd  facts,  very  suitable  for  puzzle  columns  and  
likely  to  amuse  amateurs,  but  there  is  nothing  in  them  which  
appeals much to a mathematician. The proofs are neither difficult 
nor  interesting—merely  a  little  tiresome.  The  theorems  are  not  
serious;  and  it  is  plain  that  one  reason  (though  perhaps  not  the  
most important) is the extreme speciality of both the enunciations 
and the proofs, which are not capable of any significant generali-
zation. 
16 
‘Generality’ is an ambiguous and rather dangerous word, and we 
must  be  careful  not  to  allow  it  to  dominate  our  discussion  too  
much.  It  is  used  in  various  senses  both  in  mathematics  and  in  
writings  about  mathematics,  and  there  is  one  of  these  in  particu-
lar, on which logicians have very properly laid great stress, which 
is  entirely  irrelevant  here.  In  this  sense,  which  is  quite  easy  to  
define, all  mathematical  theorems  are  equally  and  completely  
general. 
‘The certainty of mathematics’, says Whitehead
10
, ‘depends on 
its complete abstract generality.’ When we assert that 
532=+, we 
are  asserting  a  relation  between  three  groups  of  ‘things’;  and  
these  ‘things’  are  not  apples  or  pennies,  or  things  of  any  one  
particular  sort  or  another,  but  just things,  ‘any  old  things’.  The  
meaning of the statement is entirely independent of the individu-
alities  of  the  members  of  the  groups.  All  mathematical  ‘objects’

26
or ‘entities’ or ‘relations’, such as ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘+’, or ‘=’, and all 
mathematical  propositions  in  which  they  occur,  are  completely  
general  in  the  sense  of  being  completely  abstract.  Indeed  one  of  
Whitehead’s words is superfluous, since generality, in this sense, 
is abstractness. 
This sense of the word is important, and the logicians are quite 
right  to  stress  it,  since  it  embodies  a  truism  which  a  good  many  
people  who  ought  to  know  better  are  apt  to  forget.  It  is  quite  
common,  for  example,  for  an  astronomer  or  a  physicist  to  claim  
that   he   has   found   a   ‘mathematical   proof’   that   the   physical   
universe  must  behave  in  a  particular  way.  All  such  claim,  if  
interpreted literally, are strictly nonsense. It cannot be possible to 
prove  mathematically  that  there  will  be  an  eclipse  to-morrow,  
because eclipses, and other physical phenomena, do not form part 
of  the  abstract  world  of  mathematics;  and  this,  I  suppose,  all  
astronomers  would  admit  when  pressed,  however  many  eclipses  
they may have predicted correctly. 
It is obvious that we are not concerned with this sort of ‘gener-
ality’  now.  We  are  looking  for  differences  of  generality  between  
one mathematical theorem and another, and in Whitehead’s sense 
all  are  equally  general.  Thus  the  ‘trivial’  theorems  (a) and (b)  of  
§15  are  just  as  ‘abstract’  or  ‘general’  as  those  of  Euclid  and  
Pythagoras, and so is a chess problem. It makes no difference to a 
chess problem whether the pieces are white and black, or red and 
green, or whether there are physical ‘pieces’ at all; it is the same 
problem which an expert carries easily in his head and which we 
have  to  reconstruct  laboriously  with  the  aid  of  the  board.  The  
board  and  the  pieces  are  mere  devices  to  stimulate  our  sluggish  
imaginations,  and  are  no  more  essential  to  the  problem  than  the  
blackboard  and  the  chalk  are  to  the  theorems  in  a  mathematical  
lecture. 
It  is  not  this  kind  of  generality,  common  to  all  mathematical  
theorems, which we are looking for now, but the more subtle and 
elusive kind of generality which I tried to describe in rough terms 

 
27
in §15. And we must be careful not to lay too much stress even on 
generality of this kind (as I think logicians like Whitehead tend to 
do).  It  is  not  mere  ‘piling  of  subtlety  of  generalization  upon  
subtlety of generalization’
11
 which is the outstanding achievement 
of  modern  mathematics.  Some  measure  of  generality  must  be  
present  in  any  high-class  theorem,  but  too  much  tends  inevitably  
to insipidity. ‘Everything is what it is, and not another thing’, and 
the  differences  between  things  are  quite  as  interesting  as  their  
resemblances.   We   do   not   choose   our   friends   because   they   
embody  all  the  pleasant  qualities  of  humanity,  but  because  they  
are  the  people  that  they  are.  And  so  in  mathematics;  a  property  
common  to  too  many  objects  can  hardly  be  very  exciting,  and  
mathematical  ideas  also  become  dim  unless  they  have  plenty  of  
individuality. Here at any rate I can quote Whitehead on my side: 
‘it  is  the  large  generalization,  limited  by  a  happy  particularity,  
which is the fruitful conception
12
.’ 
17 
The  second  quality  which  I  demanded  in  a  significant  idea  was  
depth, and this is still more difficult to define. It has something to 
do  with  difficulty;  the  ‘deeper’  ideas  are  usually  the  harder  to  
grasp: but it is not at all the same. The ideas underlying Pythago-
ras’s   theorem   and   its   generalization   are   quite   deep,   but   no   
mathematicians now would find them difficult. On the other hand 
a theorem may be essentially superficial and yet quite difficult to 
prove  (as  are  many  ‘Diophantine’  theorems,  i.e.  theorems  about  
the solution of equations in integers). 
It  seems  that  mathematical  ideas  are  arranged  somehow  in  
strata,  the  ideas  in  each  stratum  being  linked  by  a  complex  of  
relations  both  among  themselves  and  with  those  above  and  
below.  The  lower  the  stratum,  the  deeper  (and  in  general  more

difficult)  the  idea.  Thus  the  idea  of  an  ‘irrational’  is  deeper  than  
that  of  an  integer;  and  Pythagoras’s  theorem  is,  for  that  reason,  
deeper than Euclid’s. 
Let  us  concentrate  our  attention  on  the  relations  between  the  
integers,  or  some  other  group  of  objects  lying  in  some  particular  
stratum.  Then  it  may  happen  that  one  of  these  relations  can  be  
comprehended  completely,  that  we  can  recognize  and  prove,  for  
example,  some  property  of  the  integers,  without  any  knowledge  
of the contents of lower strata. Thus we proved Euclid’s theorem 
by consideration of properties of integers only. But there are also 
many   theorems   about   integers   which   we   cannot   appreciate   
properly,   and   still   less   prove,   without   digging   deeper   and   
considering what happens below. 
It  is  easy  to  find  examples  in  the  theory  of  prime  numbers.  
Euclid’s  theorem  is  very  important,  but  not  very  deep:  we  can  
prove  that  there  are  infinitely  many  primes  without  using  any  
notion   deeper   than   that   of   ‘divisibility’.   But   new   questions   
suggest  themselves  as  soon  as  we  know  the  answer  to  this  one.  
There is an infinity of primes, but how is the infinity distributed? 
Given  a  large  number  N,  say  
80
10  or  
10
10
10,
13
  about  how  many  
primes are there less than N?
14
 When we ask these questions, we 
find  ourselves  in  a  different  position.  We  can  answer  them,  with  
rather  surprising  accuracy,  but  only  by  boring  much  deeper,  
leaving  the  integers  above  us  for  a  while,  and  using  the  most  
powerful  weapons  of  the  modern  theory  of  functions.  Thus  the  
theorem   which   answers   our   questions   (the   so-called   ‘Prime   
Number  Theorem’)  is  a  much  deeper  theorem  than  Euclid’s  or  
even Pythagoras’s. 
I  could  multiply  examples,  but  this  notion  of  ‘depth’  is  an  
elusive one even for a mathematician who can recognize it, and I

 As I mentioned in §14, there are 50,847,478 primes less than 1,000,000,000; but that is as 
far as our exact knowledge extends. 

 
29
can  hardly  suppose  that  I  could  say  anything  more  about  it  here  
that would be of much help to other readers. 
18 
There is still one point remaining over from §11, where I started 
the  comparison  between  ‘real  mathematics’  and  chess.  We  may  
take  it  for  granted  now  that  in  substance,  seriousness,  signifi-
cance,   the   advantage   of   the   real   mathematical   theorem   is   
overwhelming.  It  is  almost  equally  obvious,  to  a  trained  intelli-
gence,  that  it  has  a  great  advantage  in  beauty  also;  but  this  
advantage  is  much  harder  to  define  or  locate,  since  the  main 
defect  of  the  chess  problem  is  plainly  its  ‘triviality’,  and  the  
contrast in this respect mingles with and disturbs any more purely 
aesthetic  judgement.  What  ‘purely  aesthetic’  qualities  can  we  
distinguish  in  such  theorems  as  Euclid’s  or  Pythagoras’s?  I  will  
not risk more than a few disjointed remarks. 
In both theorems (and in the theorems, of course, I include the 
proofs)  there  is  a  very  high  degree  of  unexpectedness,  combined  
with inevitability  and  economy.  The  arguments  take  so  odd  and  
surprising  a  form;  the  weapons  used  seem  so  childishly  simple  
when  compared  with  the  far-reaching  results;  but  there  is  no  
escape  from  the  conclusions.  There  are  no  complications  of  
detail—one line of attack is enough in each case; and this is true 
too of the proofs of many much more difficult theorems, the full 
appreciation  of  which  demands  quite  a  high  degree  of  technical  
proficiency.  We  do  not  want  many  ‘variations’  in  the  proof  of  a  
mathematical  theorem:  ‘enumeration  of  cases’,  indeed,  is  one  of  
the duller forms of mathematical argument. A mathematical proof 
should   resemble   a   simple   and   clear-cut   constellation,   not   a   
scattered cluster in the Milky Way. 
A  chess  problem  also  has  unexpectedness,  and  a  certain  econ-
omy;  it  is  essential  that  the  moves  should  be  surprising,  and  that  
every  piece  of  the  board  should  play  its  part.  But  the  aesthetic  

 
30
effect is cumulative. It is essential also (unless the problem is too 
simple   to   be   really   amusing)   that   the   key-move   should   be   
followed  by  a  good  many  variations,  each  requiring  its  own  
individual answer. ‘If P-B5 then Kt-R6; if .... then ....; if .... then 
....’—the  effect  would  be  spoilt  if  there  were  not  a  good  many  
different replies. All this is quite genuine mathematics, and has its 
merits; but it is just that ‘proof by enumeration of cases’ (and of 
cases which do not, at bottom, differ at all profoundly15) which a 
real mathematician tends to despise. 
I  am  inclined  to  think  that  I  could  reinforce  my  argument  by  
appealing  to  the  feelings  of  chess-players  themselves.  Surely  a  
chess  master,  a  player  of  great  games  and  great  matches,  at  
bottom  scorns  a  problemist’s  purely  mathematical  art.  He  has  
much  of  it  in  reserve  himself,  and  can  produce  it  in  an  emer-
gency: ‘if he had made such and such a move, then I had such and 
such  a  winning  combination  in  mind.’  But  the  ‘great  game’  of  
chess  is  primarily  psychological,  a  conflict  between  one  trained  
intelligence  and  another,  and  not  a  mere  collection  of  small  
mathematical theorems. 
19 
I  must  return  to  my  Oxford  apology,  and  examine  a  little  more  
carefully  some  of  the  points  which  I  postponed  in  §6.  It  will  be  
obvious  by  now  that  I  am  interested  in  mathematics  only  as  a  
creative art. But there are other questions to be considered, and in 
particular  that  of  the  ‘utility’  (or  uselessness)  of  mathematics,  
about  which  there  is  much  confusion  of  thought.  We  must  also  
consider  whether  mathematics  is  really  quite  so  ‘harmless’  as  I  
took for granted in my Oxford lecture. 
A  science  or  an  art  may  be  said  to  be  ‘useful’  if  its  develop-
ment   increases,   even   indirectly,   the   material   well-being   and   
                                                 
15
 I believe that it is now regarded as a merit in a problem that there should be many 
variations of the same type. 

 
31
comfort  of  men,  if  it  promotes  happiness,  using  that  word  in  a  
crude  an  commonplace  way.  Thus  medicine  and  physiology  are  
useful  because  they  relieve  suffering,  and  engineering  is  useful  
because it helps us to build houses and bridges, and so to raise the 
standard  of  life  (engineering,  of  course,  does  harm  as  well,  but  
that is not the question at the moment). Now some mathematics is 
certainly  useful  in  this  way;  the  engineers  could  not  do  their  job  
without a fair working knowledge of mathematics, and mathemat-
ics  is  beginning  to  find  applications  even  in  physiology.  So  here  
we  have  a  possible  ground  for  a  defence  of  mathematics;  it  may  
not be the best, or even a particularly strong defence, but it is one 
which  we  must  examine.  The  ‘nobler’  uses  of  mathematics,  if  
such they be, the uses which it shares with all creative art, will be 
irrelevant  to  our  examination.  Mathematics  may,  like  poetry  or  
music,  ‘promote  and  sustain  a  lofty  habit  of  mind’,  and  so  
increase  the  happiness  of  mathematicians  and  even  of  other  
people;  but  to  defend  it  on  that  ground  would  be  merely  to  
elaborate  what  I  have  said  already.  What  we  have  to  consider  
now is the ‘crude’ utility of mathematics. 
20 
All  this  may  seem  very  obvious,  but  even  here  there  is  often  a  
good deal of confusion, since the most ‘useful’ subjects are quite 
commonly  just  those  which  it  is  most  useless  for  most  of  us  to  
learn. It is useful to have an adequate supply of physiologists and 
engineers;  but  physiology  and  engineering  are  not  useful  studies  
for  ordinary  men  (though  their  study  may  of  course  be  defended  
on  other  grounds).  For  my  own  part  I  have  never  once  found  
myself in a position where such scientific knowledge as I possess, 
outside  pure  mathematics,  has  brought  me  the  slightest  advan-
tage. 
It  is  indeed  rather  astonishing  how  little  practical  value  scien-
tific knowledge has for ordinary men, how dull and commonplace 

 
32
such of it as has value is, and how its value seems almost to vary 
inversely to its reputed utility. It is useful to be tolerably quick at 
common  arithmetic  (and  that,  of  course,  is  pure  mathematics).  It  
is  useful  to  know  a  little  French  or  German,  a  little  history  and  
geography, perhaps even a little economics. But a little chemistry, 
physics,  or  physiology  has  no  value  at  all  in  ordinary  life.  We  
know  that  the  gas  will  burn  without  knowing  its  constitution;  
when  our  cars  break  down  we  take  them  to  a  garage;  when  our  
stomach is out of order, we go to a doctor or a drugstore. We live 
either   by   rule   of   thumb   or   on   other   people’s   professional   
knowledge. 
However, this is a side issue, a matter of pedagogy, interesting 
only to schoolmasters who have to advise parents clamouring for 
a  ‘useful’  education  for  their  sons.  Of  course  we  do  not  mean,  
when we say that physiology is useful, that most people ought to 
study  physiology,  but  that  the  development  of  physiology  by  a  
handful  of  experts  will  increase  the  comfort  of  the  majority.  The  
questions which are important for us now are, how far mathemat-
ics  can  claim  this  sort  of  utility,  what  kinds  of  mathematics  can  
make  the  strongest  claims,  and  how  far  the  intensive  study  of  
mathematics,  as  it  is  understood  by  mathematicians,  can  be  
justified on this ground alone. 
21 
It  will  probably  be  plain  by  now  to  what  conclusions  I  am  
coming;  so  I  will  state  them  at  once  dogmatically  and  then  
elaborate  them  a  little.  It  is  undeniable  that  a  good  deal  of  
elementary mathematics—and I use the word ‘elementary’ in the 
sense  in  which  professional  mathematicians  use  it,  in  which  it  
includes,  for  example,  a  fair  working  knowledge  of  the  differen-
tial   and   integral   calculus—has   considerable   practical   utility.   
These parts of mathematics are, on the whole, rather dull; they are 
just  the  parts  which  have  the  least  aesthetic  value.  The  ‘real’  

 
33
mathematics  of  the  ‘real’  mathematicians,  the  mathematics  of  
Fermat  and  Euler  and  Gauss  and  Abel  and  Riemann,  is  almost  
wholly  ‘useless’  (and  this  is  as  true  of  ‘applied’  as  of  ‘pure’  
mathematics).  It  is  not  possible  to  justify  the  life  of  any  genuine  
professional  mathematician  on  the  ground  of  the  ‘utility’  of  his  
work. 
But  here  I  must  deal  with  a  misconception.  It  is  sometimes  
suggested  that  pure  mathematicians  glory  in  the  uselessness  of  
their  work
16
,  and  make  it  a  boast  that  it  has  no  practical  applica-
tions.  The  imputation  is  usually  based  on  an  incautious  saying  
attributed to Gauss, to the effect that, if mathematics is the queen 
of  the  sciences,  then  the  theory  of  numbers  is,  because  of  its  
supreme  uselessness,  the  queen  of  mathematics—I  have  never  
been  able  to  find  an  exact  quotation.  I  am  sure  that  Gauss’s  
saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely misinterpreted. 
If the theory of numbers could be employed for any practical and 
obviously honourable purpose, if it could be turned directly to the 
furtherance of human happiness or the relief of human suffering, 
as physiology and even chemistry can, then surely neither Gauss 
nor  any  other  mathematician  would  have  been  so  foolish  as  to  
decry  or  regret  such  applications.  But  science  works  for  evil  as  
well as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and 
both Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing 
that  there  is  one  science  at  any  rate,  and  that  their  own,  whose  
very  remoteness  from  ordinary  human  activities  should  keep  it  
gentle and clean. 
                                                 
16
 I have been accused of taking this view myself. I once said that ‘a science is said to be 
useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of 
wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life’, and this sentence, written 
in 1915, has been quoted (for or against me) several times. It was of course a conscious 
rhetorical flourish, though one perhaps excusable at the time when it was written. 

 
34
22 
There  is  another  misconception  against  which  we  must  guard.  It  
is quite natural to suppose that there is a great difference in utility 
between  ‘pure’  and  ‘applied’  mathematics.  This  is  a  delusion:  
there is a sharp disctinction between the two kinds of mathemat-
ics,  which  I  will  explain  in  a  moment,  but  it  hardly  affects  their  
utility. 
How  do  pure  and  applied  mathematicians  differ  from  one  
another? This is a question which can be answered definitely and 
about  which  there  is  general  agreement  among  mathematicians. 
There  will  be  nothing  in  the  least  unorthodox  about  my  answer,  
but it needs a little preface. 
My next two sections will have a mildly philosophical flavour. 
The  philosophy  will  not  cut  deep,  or  be  in  any  way  vital  to  my  
main theses; but I shall use words which are used very frequently 
with  definite  philosophical  implications,  and  a  reader  might  well  
become confused if I did not explain how I shall use them. 
I  have  often  used  the  adjective  ‘real’,  and  as  we  use  it  com-
monly  in  conversation.  I  have  spoken  of  ‘real  mathematics’  and  
‘real mathematicians’, as I might have spoken of ‘real poetry’ or 
‘real poets’, and I shall continue to do so. But I shall also use the 
word ‘reality’, and with two different connotations. 
In  the  first  place,  I  shall  speak  of  ‘physical  reality’,  and  here  
again I shall be using the word in the ordinary sense. By physical 
reality  I  mean  the  material  world,  the  world  of  day  and  night,  
earthquakes  and  eclipses,  the  world  which  physical  science  tries  
to describe. 
I  hardly  suppose  that,  up  to  this  point,  any  reader  is  likely  to  
find  trouble  with  my  language,  but  now  I  am  near  to  more  
difficult ground. For me, and I suppose for most mathematicians, 
there  is  another  reality,  which  I  will  call  ‘mathematical  reality’;  
and there is no sort of agreement about the nature of mathemati-
cal  reality  among  either  mathematicians  or  philosophers.  Some  

 
35
hold  that  it  is  ‘mental’  and  that  in  some  sense  we  construct  it,  
others that it is outside and independent of us. A man who could 
give  a  convincing  account  of  mathematical  reality  would  have  
solved very many of the most difficult problems of metaphysics. 
If he could include physical reality in his account, he would have 
solved them all. 
I should not wish to argue any of these questions here even if I 
were  competent  to  do  so,  but  I  will  state  my  own  position  
dogmatically in order to avoid minor misapprehensions. I believe 
that  mathematical  reality  lies  outside  us,  that  our  function  is  to  
discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove, and 
which we describe grandiloquently as our ‘creations’, are simply 
our  notes  of  our  observations.  This  view  has  been  held,  in  one  
form  or  another,  by  many  philosophers  of  high  reputation  from  
Plato onwards, and I shall use the language which is natural to a 
man who holds it. A reader who does not the philosophy can alter 
the  language:  it  will  make  very  little  difference  to  my  conclu-
sions. 
23 
The  contrast  between  pure  and  applied  mathematics  stands  out  
most  clearly,  perhaps,  in  geometry.  There  is  the  science  of  pure  
geometry
17
,   in   which   there   are   many   geometries,   projective   
geometry,  Euclidean  geometry,  non-Euclidean  geometry,  and  so  
forth. Each of these geometries is a model, a pattern of ideas, and 
is to be judged by the interest and beauty of its particular pattern. 
It  is  a  map  or  picture,  the  joint  product  of  many  hands,  a  partial  
and imperfect copy (yet exact so far as it extends) of a section of 
mathematical reality. But the point which is important to us now 
is this, that there is one thing at any rate of which pure geometries 
are not  pictures,  and  that  is  the  spatio-temporal  reality  of  the  
                                                 
17
 We must of course, for the purpose of this discussion, count as pure geometry what 
mathematicians call ‘analytical’ geometry. 

 
36
physical  world.  It  is  obvious,  surely,  that  they  cannot  be,  since  
earthquakes and eclipses are not mathematical concepts. 
The  may  sound  a  little  paradoxical  to  an  outsider,  but  it  is  a  
truism to a geometer; and I may perhaps be able to make it clearer 
by  an  illustration.  Let  us  suppose  that  I  am  giving  a  lecture  on  
some  system  of  geometry,  such  as  ordinary  Euclidean  geometry,  
and  that  I  draw  figures  on  the  blackboard  to  stimulate  the  
imagination  of  my  audience,  rough  drawings  of  straight  lines  or  
circles  or  ellipses.  It  is  plain,  first,  that  the  truth  of  the  theorems  
which  I  prove  is  in  no  way  affected  by  the  quality  of  my  
drawings. Their function is merely to bring home my meaning to 
my hearers, and, if I can do that, there would be no gain in having 
them   redrawn   by   the   most   skilful   draughtsman.   They   are   
pedagogical illustrations, not part of the real subject-matter of the 
lecture. 
Now let us go a stage further. The room in which I am lectur-
ing  is  part  of  the  physical  world,  and  has  itself  a  certain  pattern.  
The  study  of  that  pattern,  and  of  the  general  pattern  of  physical  
reality,  is  a  science  in  itself,  which  we  may  call  ‘physical  
geometry’.  Suppose  now  that  a  violent  dynamo,  or  a  massive  
gravitating body, is introduced into the room. Then the physicists 
tell  us  that  the  geometry  of  the  room  is  changed,  its  whole  
physical pattern slightly but definitely distorted. Do the theorems 
which  I  have  proved  become  false?  Surely  it  would  be  nonsense  
to suppose that the proofs of them which I have given are affected 
in any way. It would be like supposing that a play of Shakespeare 
is  changed  when  a  reader  spills  his  tea  over  a  page.  The  play  is  
independent  of  the  pages  on  which  it  is  printed,  and  ‘pure  
geometries’  are  independent  of  lecture  rooms,  or  of  any  other  
detail of the physical world. 
This  is  the  points  of  view  a  pure  mathematician.  Applied  
mathematicians,    mathematical    physicists,    naturally    take    a    
different view, since they are preoccupied with the physical world 
itself,  which  also  has  it  structure  or  pattern.  We  cannot  describe  

 
37
this pattern exactly, as we can that of a pure geometry, but we can 
say  something  significant  about  it.  We  can  describe,  sometimes  
fairly  accurately,  sometimes  very  roughly,  the  relations  which  
hold between some of its constituents, and compare them with the 
exact  relations  holding  between  constituents  of  some  system  of  
pure  geometry.  We  may  be  able  to  trace  a  certain  resemblance  
between the two sets of relations, and then the pure geometry will 
become  interesting  to  physicists;  it  will  give  us,  to  that  extent,  a  
map  which  ‘fits  the  facts’  of  the  physical  world.  The  geometer  
offers to the physicist a whole set of maps from which to choose. 
One  map,  perhaps,  will  fit  the  facts  better  than  others,  and  then  
the  geometry  which  provides  that  particular  map  will  be  the  
geometry most important for applied mathematics. I may add that 
even  a  pure  mathematician  may  find  his  appreciation  of  this  
geometry quickened, since there is no mathematician so pure that 
he feels no interest at all in the physical world; but, in so far as he 
succumbs  to  this  temptations,  he  will  be  abandoning  his  purely  
mathematical position. 
24 
There  is  another  remark  which  suggests  itself  here  and  which  
physicists   may   find   paradoxical,   though   the   paradox   will   
probably  seem  a  good  deal  less  than  it  did  eighteen  years  ago.  I  
will express in much the same words which I used in 1922 in an 
address  to  Section  A  of  the  British  Association.  My  audience  
there was composed almost entirely of physicists, and I may have 
spoken  a  little  provocatively  on  that  account;  but  I  would  still  
stand by the substance of what I said. 
I began by saying that there is probably less difference between 
the  positions  of  a  mathematician  and  of  a  physicist  than  is  
generally  supposed,  and  that  the  most  important  seems  to  me  to  
be  this,  that  the  mathematician  is  in  much  more  direct  contact  
with  reality.  This  may  seem  a  paradox,  since  it  is  the  physicist  

 
38
who deals with the subject-matter usually described as ‘real’; but 
a  very  little  reflection  is  enough  to  show  that  the  physicist’s  
reality,  whatever  it  may  be,  has  few  or  none  of  the  attributes  
which  common  sense  ascribes  instinctively  to  reality.  A  chair  
may be a collection of whirling electrons, or an idea in the mind 
of  God:  each  of  these  accounts  of  it  may  have  its  merits,  but  
neither  conforms  at  all  closely  to  the  suggestions  of  common  
sense. 
I  went  on  to  say  that  neither  physicists  nor  philosophers  have  
ever  given  any  convincing  account  of  what  ‘physical  reality’  is,  
or of how the physicist passes, from the confused mass of fact or 
sensation  with  which  he  starts,  to  the  construction  of  the  objects  
which  he  calls  ‘real’.  Thus  we  cannot  be  said  to  know  what  the  
subject-matter  of  physics  is;  but  this  need  not  prevent  us  from  
understanding roughly what a physicist is trying to do. It is plain 
that  he  is  trying  to  correlate  the  incoherent  body  of  crude  fact  
confronting   him   with   some   definite   and   orderly   scheme   of   
abstract  relations,  the  kind  of  scheme  he  can  borrow  only  from  
mathematics. 
A  mathematician,  on  the  other  hand,  is  working  with  his  own  
mathematical reality. Of this reality, as I explained in §22, I take 
a ‘realistic’ and not an ‘idealistic’ view. At any rate (and this was 
my  main  point)  this  realistic  view  is  much  more  plausible  of  
mathematical   than   of   physical   reality,   because   mathematical   
objects are so much more than what they seem. A chair or a star 
is not in the least like what it seems to be; the more we think of it, 
the  fuzzier  its  outlines  become  in  the  haze  of  sensation  which  
surrounds  it;  but  ‘2’  or  ‘317’  has  nothing  to  do  with  sensation,  
and its properties stand out the more clearly the more closely we 
scrutinize  it.  It  may  be  that  modern  physics  fits  best  into  some  
framework of idealistic philosophy—I do not believe it, but there 
are  eminent  physicists  who  say  so.  Pure  mathematics,  on  the  
other  hand,  seems  to  me  a  rock  on  which  all  idealism  founders:  
317 is a prime, not because we think so, or because our minds are 

 
39
shaped in one way rather than another, but because it is, because 
mathematical reality is built that way. 
25 
These  distinctions  between  pure  and  applied  mathematics  are  
important  in  themselves,  but  they  have  very  little  bearing  on  our  
discussion  of  the  ‘usefulness’  of  mathematics.  I  spoke  in  §21  of  
the ‘real’ mathematics of Fermat and other great mathematicians, 
the  mathematics  which  has  permanent  aesthetic  value,  as  for  
example the best Greek mathematics has, the mathematics which 
is  eternal  because  the  best  of  it  may,  like  the  best  literature,  
continue  to  cause  intense  emotional  satisfaction  to  thousands  of  
people  after  thousands  of  years.  These  men  were  all  primarily  
pure mathematicians (though the distinction was naturally a good 
deal less sharp in their days than it is now); but I was not thinking 
only   of   pure   mathematics.   I   count   Maxwell   and   Einstein,   
Eddington  and  Dirac,  among  ‘real’  mathematicians.  The  great  
modern   achievements   of   applied   mathematics   have   been   in   
relativity  and  quantum  mechanics,  and  these  subjects  are,  at  
present at any rate, almost as ‘useless’ as the theory of numbers. 
It is the dull and elementary parts of applied mathematics, as it is 
the  dull  and  elementary  parts  of  pure mathematics, that work for 
good  or  ill.  Time  may  change  all  this.  No  one  foresaw  the  
applications  of  matrices  and  groups  and  other  purely  mathemati-
cal  theories  to  modern  physics,  and  it  may  be  that  some  of  the  
‘highbrow’   applied   mathematics   will   become   ‘useful’   in   as   
unexpected  a  way;  but  the  evidence  so  far  points  to  the  conclu-
sion that, in one subject as in the other, it is what is commonplace 
and dull that counts for practical life. 
I  can  remember  Eddington  giving  a  happy  example  of  the  
unattractiveness of ‘useful’ science. The British Association held 
a  meeting  in  Leeds,  and  it  was  thought  that  the  members  might  
like to hear something of the applications of science to the ‘heavy 

 
40
woollen’  industry.  But  the  lectures  and  demonstrations  arranged  
for   this   purpose   were   rather   a   fiasco.   It   appeared   that   the   
members   (whether   citizens   of   Leeds   or   not)   wanted   to   be   
entertained,  and  the  ‘heavy  wool’  is  not  at  all  an  entertaining  
subject.  So  the  attendance  at  these  lectures  was  very  disappoint-
ing; but those who lectured on the excavations at Knossos, or on 
relativity,  or  on  the  theory  or  prime  numbers,  were  delighted  by  
the audiences that they drew. 
26 
What parts of mathematics are useful? 
First,  the  bulk  of  school  mathematics,  arithmetic,  elementary  
algebra,  elementary  Euclidean  geometry,  elementary  differential  
and integral calculus. We must except a certain amount of what is 
taught  to  ‘specialist’,  such  as  projective  geometry.  In  applied  
mathematics,  the  elements  of  mechanics  (electricity,  as  taught  in  
schools, must be classified as physics). 
Next, a fair proportion of university mathematics is also useful, 
that part of it which is really a development of school mathemat-
ics  with  a  more  finished  technique,  and  a  certain  amount  of  the  
more  physical  subjects  such  as  electricity  and  hydromechanics.  
We must also remember that a reserve of knowledge is always an 
advantage, and that the most practical of mathematicians may be 
seriously  handicapped  if  his  knowledge  is  the  bare  minimum  
which is essential to him; and for this reason we must add a little 
under  every  heading.  But  our  general  conclusion  must  be  that  
such mathematics is useful as is wanted by a superior engineer or 
a moderate physicist; and that is roughly the same thing as to say, 
such  mathematics  as  has  no  particular  aesthetic  merit.  Euclidean  
geometry, for example, is useful in so far as it is dull—we do not 
want  the  axiomatics  of  parallels,  or  the  theory  of  proportion,  or  
the construction of the regular pentagon. 

 
41
One  rather  curious  conclusion  emerges, that pure mathematics 
is  one  the  whole  distinctly  more  useful  than  applied.  A  pure  
mathematician  seems  to  have  the  advantage  on  the  practical  as  
well  as  on  the  aesthetic  side.  For  what  is  useful  above  all  is  
technique,  and  mathematical  technique  is  taught  mainly  through  
pure mathematics. 
I hope that I need not say that I am trying to decry mathemati-
cal  physics,  a  splendid  subject  with  tremendous  problems  where  
the finest imaginations have run riot. But is not the position of an 
ordinary applied mathematician in some ways a little pathetic? If 
he  wants  to  be  useful,  he  must  work  in  a  humdrum  way,  and  he  
cannot give full play to his fancy even when he wishes to rise to 
the  heights.  ‘Imaginary’  universes  are  so  much  more  beautiful  
than  this  stupidly  constructed  ‘real’  one;  and  most  of  the  finest  
products of an applied mathematician’s fancy must be rejected, as 
soon  as  they  have  been  created,  for  the  brutal  but  sufficient  
reason that they do not fit the facts. 
The  general  conclusion,  surely,  stands  out  plainly  enough.  If  
useful  knowledge  is,  as  we  agreed  provisionally  to  say,  knowl-
edge which is likely, now or in the comparatively near future, to 
contribute  to  the  material  comfort  of  mankind,  so  that  mere  
intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher 
mathematics is useless. Modern geometry and algebra, the theory 
of  numbers,  the  theory  of  aggregates  and  functions,  relativity,  
quantum  mechanics—no  one  of  the  stands  the  test  much  better  
than another, and there is no real mathematician whose life can be 
justified  on  this  round.  If  this  be  the  best,  then  Abel,  Riemann,  
and  Poincaré  wasted  their  lives;  their  contribution  to  human  
comfort was negligible, and the world would have been as happy 
a place without them. 

 
42
27 
It  may  be  objected  that  the  concept  of  ‘utility’  has  been  too  
narrow, that I have define it in terms of ‘happiness’ or ‘comfort’ 
only, and have ignored the general ‘social’ effects of mathematics 
on which recent writers, with very different sympathies, have laid 
so much stress. Thus Whitehead (who has been a mathematician) 
speaks  of  ‘the  tremendous  effort  of  mathematical  knowledge  on  
the lives of men, on their daily avocations, on the organization of 
society’;  and  Hogben  (who  is  as  unsympathetic  to  what  I  and  
other  mathematicians  call  mathematics  as  Whitehead  is  sympa-
thetic)   says   that   ‘without   a   knowledge   of   mathematics,   the   
grammar of size and order, we cannot plan the rational society in 
which  there  will  be  leisure  for  all  and  poverty  for  none’  (and  
much more to the same effect). 
I  cannot  really  believe  that  all  this  eloquence  will  do  much  to  
comfort mathematicians. The language of both writers is violently 
exaggerated,  and  both  of  them  ignore  very  obvious  distinctions.  
This is very natural in Hogben’s case, since he is admittedly not a 
mathematician;   he   means   by   ‘mathematics’   the   mathematics   
which  he  can  understand,  and  which  I  have  called  ‘school’  
mathematics. This  mathematics  has  many  uses,  which  I  have  
admitted,  which  we  can  call  ‘social’  if  we  please,  and  which  
Hogben  enforces  with  many  interesting  appeals  to  the  history  of  
mathematical discovery. It is this which gives his book its merit, 
since  it  enables  him  to  make  plain,  to  many  readers  who  never  
have been and never will be mathematicians, that there is more in 
mathematics than they though. But he has hardly any understand-
ing  of  ‘real’  mathematics  (as  any  one  who  reads  what  he  says  
about Pythagoras’s theorem, or about Euclid and Einstein, can tell 
at  one),  and  still  less  sympathy  with  it  (as  he  spares  no  pains  to  
show).   ‘Real’   mathematics   is   to   him   merely   an   object   of   
contemptuous pity. 

 
43
It  is  not  lack  of  understanding  or  of  sympathy  which  is  the  
trouble  in  Whitehead’s  cases;  but  he  forgets,  is  his  enthusiasm,  
distinctions  with  which  he  is  quite  familiar.  The  mathematics  
which  has  this  ‘tremendous  effect’  on  the  ‘daily  avocations  of  
men’  and  on  ‘the  organization  of  society’  is  not  the  Whitehead  
but the Hogben mathematics. The mathematics which can be used 
‘for  ordinary  purposes  by  ordinary  men’  is  negligible,  and  that  
which  can  be  used  by  economists  or  sociologist  hardly  rises  to  
‘scholarship  standard’.  The  Whitehead  mathematics  may  affect  
astronomy or physics profoundly, philosophy only appreciably—
high thinking of one kind is always likely to affect high thinking 
of another—but it has extremely little effect on anything else. Its 
‘tremendous  effects’  have  been,  not  on  men  generally,  but  on  
men like Whitehead. 
28 
There are then two mathematics. There is the real mathematics of 
the  real  mathematicians,  and  there  is  what  I  call  the  ‘trivial’  
mathematics,  for  want  of  a  better  word.  The  trivial  mathematics  
may be justified by arguments which would appeal to Hogben, or 
other  writers  of  his  school,  but  there  is  no  such  defence  for  the  
real  mathematics,  which  must  be  justified  as  arts  if  it  can  be  
justified  at  all.  There  is  nothing  in  the  least  paradoxical  or  
unusual in this view, which is that held commonly by mathemati-
cians. 
We  have  still  one  more  question  to  consider.  We  have  con-
cluded  that  the  trivial  mathematics  is,  on  the  whole,  useful,  and  
that  the  real  mathematics,  on  the  whole,  is  not;  that  the  trivial  
mathematics  does,  and  the  real  mathematics  does  not,  ‘do  good’  
in  a  certain  sense;  but  we  have  still  to  ask  whether  either  sort  of  
mathematics  does  harm.  It  would  be  paradoxical  to  suggest  that  
mathematics of any sort does much harm in time of peace, so that 
we  are  driven  to  the  consideration  of  the  effects  of  mathematics  

 
44
on  war.  It  is  every  difficult  to  argue  such  questions  at  all  
dispassionately  now,  and  I  should  have  preferred  to  avoid  them;  
but some sort of discussion seems inevitable. Fortunately, it need 
not be a long one. 
There  is  one  comforting  conclusions  which  is  easy  for  a  real  
mathematician.  Real  mathematics  has  no  effects  on  war.  No  one  
has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory 
of  numbers  or  relativity,  and  it  seems  very  unlikely  that  anyone  
will  do  so  for  many  years.  It  is  true  that  there  are  branches  of  
applied  mathematics,  such  as  ballistics  and  aerodynamics,  which  
have  been  developed  deliberately  for  war  and  demand  a  quite  
elaborate  technique:  it  is  perhaps  hard  to  call  them  ‘trivial’,  but  
none  of  them  has  any  claim  to  rank  as  ‘real’.  They  are  indeed  
repulsively  ugly  and  intolerably  dull;  even  Littlewood  could  not  
make  ballistics  respectable,  and  if  he  could  not  who  can?  So  a  
real mathematician has his conscience clear; there is nothing to be 
set against any value his work may have; mathematics is, as I said 
at Oxford, a ‘harmless and innocent’ occupation. 
The  trivial  mathematics,  on  the  other  hand,  has  many  applica-
tions  in  war.  The  gunnery  experts  and  aeroplane  designers,  for  
example,  could  not  do  their  work  without  it.  And  the  general  
effect of these applications is plain: mathematics facilitates (if not 
so  obviously  as  physics  or  chemistry)  modern,  scientific,  ‘total’  
war. 
It  is  not  so  clear  as  it  might  seem  that  this  is  to  be  regretted,  
since   there   are   two   sharply   contrasted   views   about   modern   
scientific war. The first and the most obvious is that the effect of 
science on war is merely to magnify its horror, both by increasing 
the sufferings of the minority who have to fight and by extending 
them to other classes. This is the most natural and orthodox view. 
But there is a very different view which seems also quite tenable, 
and  which  has  been  stated  with  great  force  by  Haldane  in  
Callinicus
18
.  It  can  be  maintained  that  modern  warfare  is  less

45
horrible  than  the  warfare  of  pre-scientific  times;  that  bombs  are  
probably more merciful than bayonets; that lachrymatory gas and 
mustard  gas  are  perhaps  the  most  humane  weapons  yet  devised  
by  military  science;  and  that  the  orthodox  view  rests  solely  on  
loos-thinking sentimentalism
19
. It may also by urged (though this 
was  not  one  of  Haldane’s  theses)  that  the  equalization  of  risks  
which  science  was  expected  to  bring  would  be  in  the  long  range  
salutary;  that  a  civilian’s  life  is  not  worth  more  than  a  soldier’s,  
nor a woman’s more than a man’s; that anything is better than the 
concentration  of  savagery  on  one  particular  class;  and  that,  in  
short, the sooner war comes ‘all out’ the better. 
I do not know which of these views is nearer to the truth. It is 
an  urgent  and  a  moving  question,  but  I  need  not  argue  it  here.  It  
concerns   only   the   ‘trivial’   mathematics,   which   it   would   be   
Hogben’s  business  to  defend  rather  than  mine.  The  cases  for  his  
mathematics  may  be  rather  more  than  a  little  soiled;  the  case  for  
mine is unaffected. 
Indeed,  there  is  more  to  be  said,  since  there  is  one  purpose  at  
any rate which the real mathematics may serve in war. When the 
world  is  mad,  a  mathematician  may  find  in  mathematics  an  
incomparable  anodyne.  For  mathematics  is,  of  all  the  arts  and  
sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathemati-
cian should be of all men the one who can most easily take refuge 
where,  as  Bertrand  Russell  says,  ‘one  at  least  of  our  nobler  
impulses  can  best  escape  from  the  dreary  exile  of  the  actual  
world.  It  is  a  pity  that  it  should  be  necessary  to  make  one  very  
serious reservation—he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a 
contemplative  but  a  creative  subject;  no  one  can  draw  much  
consolation  from  it  when  he  has  lost  the  power  or  the  desire  to  
create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It

 I do not wish to prejudge the question by this much misused word; it may be used quite 
legitimately to indicate certain type of unbalanced emotion. Many people, of course, use 
‘sentimentalism’ as a term of abuse for other people’s decent feelings, and ‘realism’ as a 
disguise for their own brutality.

is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, 
and it would be silly to bother about him.

I will end with a summary of my conclusions, but putting them in 
a  more  personal  way.  I  said  at  the  beginning  that  anyone  who  
defends his subject will find that he is defending himself; and my 
justification  of  the  life  of  a  professional  mathematician  is  bound  
to be, at bottom, a justification of my own. Thus this concluding 
section will be in its substance a fragment of autobiography. 
I  cannot  remember  ever  having  wanted  to  be  anything  but  a  
mathematician. I suppose that it was always clear that my specific 
abilities lay that way, and it never occurred to me to question the 
verdict of my elders. I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any 
passion  for  mathematics,  and  such  notions  as  I  may  have  had  of  
the  career  of  a  mathematician  were  far  from  noble.  I  thought  of  
mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted 
to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could 
do so most decisively. 
I  was  about  fifteen  when  (in  a  rather  odd  way)  my  ambitions  
took a sharper turn. There is a book by ‘Alan St Aubyn’
20
 called 
A Fellow of Trinity, one of a series dealing with what is supposed 
to  be  Cambridge  college  life.  I  suppose  that  it  is  a  worse  book  
than  most  of  Marie  Corelli’s;  but  a  book  can  hardly  be  entirely  
bad if it fires a clever boy’s imagination. There are two heroes, a 
primary  hero  called  Flowers,  who  is  almost  wholly  good,  and  a  
secondary  hero,  a  much  weaker  vessel,  called  Brown.  Flowers  
and Brown find many dangers in university life, but the worst is a 
gambling  saloon  in  Chesterton
21
  run  by  the  Misses  Bellenden,  
two  fascinating  but  extremely  wicked  young  ladies.  Flowers  
survives   all   these   troubles,   is   Second   Wrangler   and   Senior

 ‘Alan St Aubyn’ was Mrs Frances Marshall, wife of Matthew Marshall.

 Actually, Chesterton lacks picturesque features.

Classic, and succeeds automatically to a Fellowship (as I suppose 
he  would  have  done  then).  Brown  succumbs,  ruins  his  parents,  
takes  to  drink,  is  saved  from  delirium  tremens  during  a  thunder-
storm  only  by  the  prayers  of  the  Junior  Dean,  has  much  difficult  
in obtaining even an Ordinary Degree, and ultimately becomes a 
missionary.  The  friendship  is  not  shattered  by  these  unhappy  
events,  and  Flowers’s  thought  stray  to  Brown,  with  affectionate  
pity, as he drinks port and eats walnuts for the first time in Senior 
Combination Room. 
Now  Flowers  was  a  decent  enough  fellow  (so  far  as  ‘Alan  St  
Aubyn’  could  draw  one),  but  even  my  unsophisticated  mind  
refused to accept him as clever. If he could do these things, why 
not   I?   In   particular,   the   final   scene   in   Combination   Room   
fascinated  me  completely,  and  from  that  time,  until  I  obtained  
one, mathematics meant to me primarily a Fellowship at Trinity. 
I found at once, when I came to Cambridge, that a Fellowship 
implied  ‘original  work’,  but  it  was  a  long  time  before  I  formed  
any  definite  idea  of  research.  I  had  of  course  found  at  school,  as  
every  future  mathematician  odes,  that  I  could  often  do  things  
much  better  than  my  teachers;  and  even  at  Cambridge,  I  found,  
though naturally much less frequently, that I could sometimes do 
things  better  than  the  College  lecturers.  But  I  was  really  quite  
ignorant, even when I took the Tripos, of the subjects on which I 
have spent the rest of my life; and I still thought of  mathematics  
as essentially a ‘competitive’ subject. My eyes were first opened 
by  Professor  Love,  who  taught  me  for  a  few  terms  and  gave  me  
my first serious conception of analysis. But the great debt which I 
owe  to  him—he  was,  after  all,  primarily  an  applied  mathemati-
cian—was  his  advice  to  read  Jordan’s  famous  Cours  d’anlyse; 
and  I  shall  never  forget  the  astonishment  with  which  I  read  that  
remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians 
of  my  generation,  and  learnt  for  the  first  time  as  I  read  it  what  
mathematics  really  meant.  From  that  time  onwards,  I  was  in  my  

 
48
way  a  real  mathematician,  with  sound  mathematical  ambitions  
and a genuine passion for mathematics. 
I wrote a great deal during the next ten years, but very little of 
any importance; there are not more than four or five papers which 
I can still remember with some satisfaction. The real crisis of my 
career came ten or twelve years later,  in  1911,  when  I  began  my  
long   collaboration   with   Littlewood,   and   in   1913,   when   I   
discovered  Ramanujan.    All  my  best  work  since  then  has  been  
bound  up  with  theirs,  and  it  is  obvious  that  my  association  with  
them was the decisive event of my life. I still say to myself when 
I  am  depressed,  and  find  myself  forced to listen to pompous and 
tiresome people, ‘Well, I have done one the thing you could never 
have done, and that is to have collaborated  with  both  Littlewood  
and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.’ It is to them that 
I  owe  an  unusually  late  maturity:  I  was  at  my  best  a  little  past  
forty,  when  I  was  a  professor  at  Oxford.  Since  then  I  have  
suffered from that steady deterioration which is the common fate 
of  elderly  men  and  particularly  of  elderly  mathematicians.  A  
mathematician may still be competent enough at sixty, but if it is 
useless to expect him to have original ideas. 
It is plain now that my life, for what it is worth, is finished, and 
that  nothing  I  can  do  can  perceptibly  increase  or  diminish  its  
value.  It  is  very  difficult  to  be  dispassionate,  but  I  count  it  a  
‘success’; I have had more reward and not less than was due to a 
man  of  my  particular  grade  of  ability.  I  have  held  a  series  of  
comfortable  and  ‘dignified’  positions.  I  have  had  very  little  
trouble  with  the  duller  routine  of  universities.  I  hate  ‘teaching’,  
and have had to do very little, such teaching as I have done been 
almost entirely supervision of research; I love lecturing, and have 
lectured a great deal to extremely able classes; and I have always 
had  plenty  of  leisure  for  the  researches  which  have  been  the  one  
great  permanent  happiness  of  my  life.  I  have  found  it  easy  to  
work with others, and have collaborated on a large scale with two 
exceptional  mathematicians;  and  this  has  enable  me  to  add  to  

 
49
mathematics  a  good  deal  more  than  I  could  reasonable  have  
expected.   I   have   had   my   disappointments,   like   any   other   
mathematician,  but  none  of  them  has  been  too  serious  or  has  
made me particularly unhappy. If I had been offered a life neither 
better  nor  worse  when  I  was  twenty,  I  would  have  accepted  
without hesitation. 
It  seems  absurd  to  suppose  that  I  could  have  ‘done  better’.  I  
have  no  linguistic  or  artistic  ability,  and  very  little  interest  in  
experimental  science.  I  might  have  been  a  tolerable  philosopher,  
but not one of a very original kind. I think that I might have made 
a  good  lawyer;  but  journalism  is  the  only  profession,  outside  
academic life, in which I should have felt really confident of my 
changes. There is no doubt that I was right to be a mathematician, 
if the criterion is to be what is commonly called success. 
My  choice  was  right,  then,  if  what  I  wanted  was  a  reasonable  
comfortable  and  happy  life.  But  solicitors  and  stockbrokers  and  
bookmakers often lead comfortable and happy lives, and it is very 
difficult to see how the world is richer for their existence. Is there 
any  sense  in  which  I  can  claim  that  my  life  has  been  less  futile  
than  theirs?  It  seems  to  me  again  that  there  is  only  one  possible  
answer: yes, perhaps, but, if so, for one reason only: 
I have never done anything ‘useful’. No discovery of mine has 
made,  or  is  likely  to  make,  directly  or  indirectly,  for  good  or  ill,  
the least difference to the amenity of the world. I have helped to 
train  other  mathematicians,  but  mathematicians  of  the  same  kind  
as  myself,  and  their  work  has  been,  so  far  at  any  rate  as  I  have  
helped  them  to  it,  as  useless  as  my  own.  Judged  by  all  practical  
standards,  the  value  of  my  mathematical  life  is  nil;  and  outside  
mathematics  it  is  trivial  anyhow.  I  have  just  one  chance  of  
escaping  a  verdict  of  complete  triviality, that I may be judged to 
have created something worth creating. And that I have created is 
undeniable: the question is about its value. 
The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has 
been a mathematician in the same sense which I have been one, is 

 
50
this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others 
to add more; and that these somethings have a value which differs 
in  degree  only,  and  not  in  kind,  from  that  of  the  creations  of  the  
great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, 
who have left some kind of memorial behind them.

Note 
Professor Broad and Dr Snow have both remarked to me that, if I 
am  to  strike  a  fair  balance  between  the  good  and  evil  done  by  
science, I must not allow myself to be too obsessed by its effects 
on  war;  and  that,  even  when  I  am  thinking  of  them,  I  must  
remember  that  it  has  many  very  important  effects  besides  those  
which are purely destructive. Thus (to take the latter point first), I 
must  remember  (a)  that  the  organization  of  an  entire  population  
for  war  is  only  possible  through  scientific  methods;  (b)  that  
science  has  greatly  increased  the  power  of  propaganda,  which  is  
used   almost   exclusively   for   evil;   and   (c)   that   it   has   made   
‘neutrality’ almost impossible or unmeaning, so that there are no 
longer ‘islands of peace’ from which sanity and restoration might 
spread  out  gradually  after  war.  All  this,  of  course,  tends  to  
reinforce the case against science. On the other hand, even if we 
press  this  case  to  the  utmost,  it  is  hardly  possible  to  maintain  
seriously  that  the  evil  done  by  science  is  not  altogether  out-
weighed  by  the  good.  For  example,  if  ten  million  lives  were  lost  
in  every  war,  the  net  effect  of  science  would  still  have  been  to  
increase  the  average  length  of  life.  In  short,  my  §28  is  much  too  
‘sentimental’. 
I  do  not  dispute  the  justice  of  these  criticisms,  but,  for  the  
reasons which I state in my preface, I have found it impossible to 
meet  them  in  my  text,  and  content  myself  with  this  acknowl-
edgement. 
Dr Snow had also made an interesting point about §8. Even if 
we  grant  that  ‘Archimedes  will  be  remembered  when  Aeschylus  
is forgotten’, is not mathematical fame a little too ‘anonymous’ to 
be wholly satisfying? We could form a fairly coherent picture of 
the  personality  of  Aeschylus  (still  more,  of  course,  of  Shake-
speare or Tolstoi) from their works alone, while Archimedes and 
Eudoxus would remain mere names.

Mr  J.  M.  Lomas  put  this  point  more  picturesquely  when  we  
were  passing  the  Nelson  column  in  Trafalgar  square.  If  I  had  a  
statue  on  a  column  in  London,  would  I  prefer  the  columns  to  be  
so  high  that  the  statue  was  invisible,  or  low  enough  for  the  
features  to  be  recognizable?  I  would  choose  the  first  alternative,  
Dr Snow, presumably, the second.
